            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE former Edition of this Treatiſe touching the Sacraments, ſome eight yeares ſince pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed, was not onely by your ſelfe louingly receiued, but by diuers godly Chriſtians be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond my expectation fauourably and friendly accepted. And being at length content to yeeld to a new Impreſsion, it hath fared with mee in peruſing this worke, as with him that goeth about to repaire an old houſe. For albeit he purpoſe with himſelfe to pull downe a little, or to make a ſlender addition and alteration in the building, yet when once he beginneth to ſtirre and meddle with the old frame, one piece draweth downe another, and the augmen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of one part, I know not how, in a pleaſing manner pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cureth the adding and annexing of another. In like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, when I determined to review and peruſe this booke, mine intent was no more then heere and there to inſert a little, as time, reading, conference, and better iudgement haue giuen occaſion to ſee farther: but beeing entred into the matter, and one change cauſing another, the worke is riſen to this volume, like a flood that ſwelleth by the acceſſe and comming in of other waters, that it may rather ſeeme to be the making of a new, then the amending of an olde. I haue endeuoured heere to ſet before the eyes of all that wil
<pb facs="tcp:21092:3"/> vouchſafe to reade theſe lines, the nature and vſe of the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments, which were inſtituted of almighty God to admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh vs by their myſticall ſignification, both of his goodnes and of our weakneſſe, being as ſignes and ſeales to aſſure vs of Chriſt and of his righteouſneſſe, and all his merits.</p>
            <p>There are diuers ſorts of ſignes mentioned in the holy Scriptures, which may be fitly ſorted into foure ranks. Some are naturall,<note place="margin">Mat. 16, 2, 3</note> as the clouds be a ſigne of raine; the rednes of the sky in the euening, of faire weather; the lowring of the sky in the morning, of foule weather. Some are ciuill, as a ſword carried before a Magiſtrate is a ſigne of his autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,<note place="margin">Rom. 13, 4.</note> as the Conſuls of <hi>Rome</hi> had their roddes and axe born by their officers. Some are miraculous, as we ſee in <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deons</hi> fleece,<note place="margin">Iudg. 6, 36. Mat. 24, 29</note> which was wet when the earth was dry, and dry when the earth was wet: ſuch ſhall be in the Sunne and Moone, and in the ſtarres, in the end of the world, as the Lord declareth. Other are religious ſignes which apper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine to piety and godlineſſe and an heauenly life: of which ſome are tokens of things paſt,<note place="margin">Exod. 16, 33 Heb 9, 4. Leuit. 8, 7</note> as the reſeruing of <hi>Manna:</hi> ſome of things preſent, as the garments of the Prieſts and Leuites, and their often clenſings and purifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
            <p>Some be ſignes of things to come, as the ſacrifices and oblations. But the Sacraments of the new Couenant and laſt Teſtament of CHRIST ſealed by his precious blood (which wee haue heere deſcribed) ſerue as monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and memorials of all theſe, euen to note out vnto vs bleſsings paſt, and preſent, and to come. For they ſignifie the death and paſsion of Chriſt which is already paſt: likewiſe the promiſe of grace and forgiueneſſe, which are preſent to the mindes of all right receiuers. Laſtly, holineſſe of life, mortification of ſinne, repentance from dead workes, and the fruites of faith, heereafter more and more to be perfected and performed, as alſo the reſurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the body and eternall life, which are to bee accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhed in the world to come.</p>
            <p>Eſpecially I haue beene carefull<note n="a" place="margin">The corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the Romane Church vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>masked.</note> to vnmaske the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> if I may call that vnmask<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, which is in it ſelfe ſo palpable and apparent, that who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer
<pb facs="tcp:21092:3"/> hath the ſight of the eye may quickly eſpy them, or the vſe of reaſon may eaſily diſcouer them; wherein wee haue the full conſent of the former and purer Churches. If we wil a little conſider the truth of this point, and compare the doctrine of the reformed Churches with the polluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and prophanations of the Romiſh Synogogue, we ſhal plainely perceiue, that light and darknes are not more dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent and repugnant, then theſe are the one to the other. Indeed they oftentimes appeale to the ſentence of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, as if their faith were the ancient faith, and their do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine had the approbation of elder times, howbeit all this foppery ſerueth but for a flouriſh, to varniſh their rotten poſtes with deceitfull colours; foraſmuch as they are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent the Fathers ſhall be expoſiters of the Scriptures, but it is with this caueat and condition, that themſelues will bee Interpreters of the Fathers.</p>
            <p>Wherefore I will<note n="b" place="margin">3 points diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſſed.</note> propound as it were in a Table 3. points to be handled: Firſt, their contrarieties and oppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions ſtanding againſt the truth. Secondly, their contenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and contradictions remaining among themſelues. Laſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, I will anſwere their obiection that thinke the matter is not ſo cleere on our ſide as we pretend, who contemne Tranſubſtantiation and the reall preſence, and maintaine the ſpirituall eating againſt the carnall and Capernaiticall.</p>
            <p>Firſt, touching their corruptions<note n="c" place="margin">Compariſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> between the Lords ſupper &amp; the Maſſe.</note> and contrarieties, they are ſo notable and notorious to all the world, that they can no longer hide them and conceale them, as we may gather by comparing the inſtitution of Chriſt, with the traditions and abhominations of Antichriſt. Chriſt deliuered his laſt Supper, as he ſate at the Table with his Diſciples, where they did all eate as at a banket: but Antichriſt hath turned and transformed this Supper into the abhominable Idoll of the Maſſe, which hath no ſhew or appearance of any feaſt at all, where the Prieſt plaieth this Pageant alone, hee ſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth not at the Table, but ſtandeth at the Altar, turneth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way his face from the people, beeing belike aſhamed that they ſhould ſee his fraud and legier-demaine. Chriſt took bread<note n="d" place="margin">Mat. 26.26. Mar. 14, 22. Luk. 22, 19. 1 Cor. 11, 24</note> as the Euangeliſts note, ſuch no doubt as was ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
<pb facs="tcp:21092:4"/> to be eaten with the Paſchall Lambe, and not of purpoſe prepared apart for the Supper: but in the papacy they vſe thin wafers, not fit to nouriſh, nor ſcarce deſeruing the name of bread, howbeit ſhaped after the faſhion of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, and ſtamped with the Image of a Crucifixe, thereby to call to remembrance that the Lord was betrayed of <hi>Iudas</hi> for thirty pence, and that hee was crucified for vs vpon the Croſſe. Chriſt gaue thanks to his Father for the benefit of our redemption, and bleſſed the bread and ſanctified it to be the figure and remembrance of his body giuen for vs: but <hi>Bellarmine</hi>
               <note n="e" place="margin">Bellar. lib. <hi>4,</hi> cap. <hi>13.</hi> de Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chariſt.</note> vnderſtandeth it that he turned the ſubſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of the bread into the ſubſtance of his body; ſo that this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecration is no other with them the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the monſter of tranſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantiation, whereof there is not one word or ſillable in the word of God. Chriſt brake the bread, not onely that hee might diſtribute it and diuide it among them, but to the end he might repreſent the breaking, that is, the crucifying of his body: but among the papiſts the bread is not broken, but euery one hath a little wafer: &amp; in the Maſſe the Prieſt breaketh the hoſt, but he doth not diſtribute it or deliuer it among thoſe that are preſent. Chriſt gaue the bread to the Diſciples: whereas they giue it not to the people, but offer it vp to God the Father, imagining that they offer vp his Son for the ſins of the quick and the dead, and for the ſoules departed and detained in Purgatory, and they lift vp the bread and ſhew it to the beholders to be worſhipped of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: al which tend to the diſhonour of God, to weaken the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort of the people, and to crucifie him againe, who by the onely ſacrifice of his death, hath purged away the ſins of al that beleeue, and purchaſed vnto them the fauour of God his Father. Chriſt willed his Diſciples to take the bread into their hand,<note place="margin">

               <hi>I beleeue that the body of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt ſenſibly and in very deed is touched with the hands of the Prieſts, broken and ground with the

Thus they make the Supper of Chriſt inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted for Myce and vermine, and hold that beaſtes may haue as great benefit by carnall eating, as the beleeuers. They cannot agree among themſelues, whether the ſubſtance of bread bee turned into the body of Chriſt, or whether the bread be conſumed to nothing, &amp; then the body of Chriſt brought in place of it? Whether the water mingled with wine in the Challice be tranſubſtantiated into the bloud of Chriſt? or be conſumed to nothing? or be turned into the vitall humors of Chriſt or not? whether the wormes engen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred in the Euchariſt come from the ſubſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of the bread, or from the accidents, or from the ayre? Laſtly, there is great diuerſity between them, with what words their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecration is wrought, and how many words are directly &amp; preciſely required to the forme therof, touching the which they are not as yet agreed.</p>
            <p>It were no hard matter to make an whole volume of ſuch differences, howbeit I will leaue them in their owne deui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, and come to the third point; which is, to anſwere thoſe that pleade the cauſe of <hi>Baal,</hi> and are bold to ſpeake what they dare for the whore of <hi>Babell:</hi> who albeit they liue a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong vs, and would bee thought to bee of vs: yet they are
<pb facs="tcp:21092:5"/> neyther affrayd nor aſhamed to affirme<note n="n" place="margin">Againſt ſuch as would not haue it diſpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined, how Chriſt is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent.</note> that the contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſie of the Supper is not ſo manifeſt as we teach, nor the words of Chriſt ſo eaſie as we affirme, nor the iudgement of the Fathers ſo cleer as we pretend, nor the maner of eating ſo neceſſary to be holden as we define: that we are to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue that Chriſt is preſent, but how he is preſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t we ſhould not diſpute, whether it be carnally, or whether it bee ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually. Indeed we feare not to teach that there is no tranſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lementation or tranſubſtantiation, that is, no reall turning of the bread into the body, and the wine into the bloud of Chriſt: but when he ſaid, <hi>This is my body,</hi> hee intendeth not to change one ſubſtance into another, but meaneth, This bread is a ſigne or Sacrament of my body, which is deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to death for vs and for our ſaluation. And when he ſaith <hi>This Cup is the new Testament in my bloud,</hi> hee vnderſtandeth that the wine in the Cup is a Sacrament of the new Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, of our reconciliation to God, and of our communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and participation of Chriſt with al his benefits; &amp; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we doubt not to call this Sacrament, a repreſentation, a reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>brance, an image, a token, a type, an antitype, a ſigne, a figure, and ſuch like. Now that it may appeare that the wordes of inſtitution are truely expounded, and haue the conſtant conſent and full approbation of al antiquity,<note n="o" place="margin">The ancie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t Fathers teach the ſame tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching the Sup<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>per that we doe.</note> let vs produce our witneſſes, and ſee what the Fathers of the grayeſt heads before vs haue declared &amp; deliuered. But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we come to fight hand to hand with theſe aduerſaries, and to diſcharge the volly of ſhot which we haue in ſtore, it ſhall not be amiſſe to ſet downe certaine inducements, as it were certaine preparatiues to leade vs to beleeue, that the Doctours of the Church are no leſſe ours in this cauſe and controuerſie, then <hi>Caluine</hi> and <hi>Beza,</hi> and the later writers. For firſt, we ſhal neuer read in all the monuments of former times any mention of adoration or eleuation of the hoſt, or that the maner was to lick vp the drops of the Challice, or to ſweepe the place where a drop was falne, or to burne the wormes which haue corrupted or conſumed it, or to ſeeke out the hoſt whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> it is vomited vp, &amp; to commend thoſe that will ſwallow it againe. Secondly, <hi>Ierome</hi> teacheth that after the communion they had a common banket in the Church,
<pb facs="tcp:21092:6"/> whereat they did eate vp all that<note n="q" place="margin">Ierom. vpon <hi>1</hi> Cor. <hi>11.</hi>
               </note> remained after the admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtration of the Supper. If then it were the manner of many Churches to eate the reſidue at their loue feaſts and ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry bankets, doubtleſſe they did not thinke it was Chriſt himſelfe which was eaten therein. Thirdly, the cuſtome was in ſome places to burne the remainder of the<note n="r" place="margin">Heſych. lib. <hi>2.</hi> in Leuit. ca. <hi>8.</hi>
               </note> 
               <hi>Eucha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſt,</hi> and therefore it could not bee that they ſhould beleeue that the bread was the very body of Chriſt, foraſmuch as it had beene horrible impiety and a moſt deteſtable prophana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to burne it, as a<note n="ſ" place="margin">

Fourthly, another teacheth that in other Churches the cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome was to giue the parts that were not ſpent and vſed, to little children<note n="t" place="margin">Niceph lib. <hi>17.</hi> cap. <hi>25.</hi>

               <hi>to examine themſelues,</hi> and therefore they were not of opinion with the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi> Fiftly, the Maſſe it ſelfe vſed at this day, and the prayers vſed in it do ſpeake for the truth againſt their Idolatrous practiſe. Heereunto commeth their <hi>ſurſum corda,</hi> when they exhort to lift vp the heart on high to God, and the prayers crauing of God that their oblation may be acceptable, which is the figure and ſigne of the body and blood of our Lord: whereas if the Church had beleeued that they did eate Chriſt with their mouths, they might haue ſtayed their eyes beneath, gazing and gaping vpon that which the Prieſt held in his hands, and needed not to haue lifted vp their harts to Chriſt Ieſus, which ſitteth at the right hand of his Father in the higheſt heauens.

There is no knowledge compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable to the knowledge of Gods word: there is no parcel of Gods word more holſome and heauenly then the Sacraments. There is no Sacrament more excellent and effectuall then the Supper of the Lord, which is a medicine to them that are ſicke, a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeruatiue to them that are whole, a cordiall to them that are weake, and a precious treaſure to them that are in wants: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing an inſtrument to conuay vnto vs the benefit of Chriſts Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, and the aſſurance of our owne ſaluation.

<pb facs="tcp:21092:9"/> Touching the errours crept in among vs as it were into the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome of the Church, as well in practiſe as in iudgement, I haue aymed eſpecially at two things; both to reforme ſome, and to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme others.

            <p>True it is, all men almoſt come thicke and threefold at Ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, or elſe they ſhould not think themſelues to be good ſubiects; then they offer themſelues without difference and diſtinction: howbeit at other times they make no co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſcience of their ordinary abſence &amp; almoſt continual negligence.

            <p>Touching the information of ſuch as erre in opinion, there are many of our good brethren and ſiſters that abſtain from the Communion, becauſe they may not ſit at the celebration there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, and ſo condemne the reuerent geſture of kneeling comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in our Church, as vtterly vnlawfull and vnwarranted:<note place="margin">The lawful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of knee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling at the Communion ſhewed.</note> to yeeld vnto whom ſome ſatisfaction (if it may be) I haue made a long degreſſion in the third Book, if that may be called a digreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion which ſetteth downe the duties of the Communicants, and giueth them direction what they ought to doe, and what they ought not to doe. I am not ignorant that ſome in the earneſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of their ſpirit, and forwardneſſe to goe before others, haue written much againſt kneeling, with the applauſe of many, and will by no meanes yeelde thus much, that it be in it ſelfe an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different geſture, but make it as bad and as groſſe a thing, as to kneele before a crucifixe, which is flat Idolatry; as though wee did deſtroy the nature of a Sacrament, &amp; make the ſupper to be

But let vs ſet downe the force of the reaſon in forme, and ſo bring it as if it were before the tribunall Seate of iudgement, where it ſhall receiue an honourable tryall. For thus they conclude,
<q>
                  <p>If this Sacrament be a Supper or a banket, then the geſture of kneeling is vnlawful, and ought not to bee vſed at it.</p>
                  <p>But this Sacrament is a Supper or a banket:</p>
                  <p>Therefore the geſture of kneeling is vnlawfull, and ought not to be vſed at it.</p>
               </q> The force of this reaſon and as it were the life of it (if it haue any) ſtandeth vpon this, that ſuch gesture is neceſſary to be v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed at this Sacrament as is accuſtomed at a Supper or at a ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket, and no other: becauſe then we ſhall make a banket to bee no banket, <label type="milestone">

               </gap>ty.<note place="margin">The firſt an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere.</note> To this I reply diuerſly. First I ſay the reaſon deſtroyeth it ſelfe, as a man that thrusteth his ſword into his owne body and bowels,<note place="margin">Iudges 9, 22.</note> like the <hi>Midianites</hi> that ſlew one another. For this maketh the geſture to bee altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther vncertaine, and a variable ceremony not belonging to the ſubſtance of the Supper, inaſmuch as one geſture is vſed com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly at bankets, and another at ſuppers at bankets ſtanding: at ſuppers, ſitting. So then, if the former reaſon be worth any thing and haue any ſtrength at all in it, then vpon their owne ground-worke this reaſon following is fully as good &amp; as ſtrong in any Court of Conſcience whereſoeuer: If this Sacrament be a banket, then the geſture of ſitting is vnlawfull and is not to he vſed at it, becauſe ſuch geſture is neceſſary to be vſed as is vſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all at bankets: but this Sacrament is a banket; therefore ſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting is vnlawfull &amp; not to be vſed at it. If their reaſon be good, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> this alſo is as good, being taken word forword out of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer. Again, in contrary manner we may reaſon thus: If this Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament be a Supper, then ſtanding at it is vnlawfull: becauſe
<pb facs="tcp:21092:10"/> ſuch geſture onely is to be vſed as is ordinary at Suppers: But this Sacrament is a ſupper: Therefore ſtanding at it is vnlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful. Thus we ſee how this reaſon is at enmity and defiance with the truth and with it ſelfe; and whiles it goeth about to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy kneeling, it ouerthroweth both ſitting and ſtanding, for ſitting conuinceth ſtanding, and ſtanding condemneth ſitting. Secondly,<note place="margin">The ſecond anſwere.</note> the foundation of the former reaſon ſtandeth vpon a Metaphor or borrowed ſpeech, and therefore there can no ſound and certaine concluſion be drawne and diducted from it, eſpecially to take it in a proper ſenſe, &amp; to ſet the whole waight of the worke as it were a pillar of the houſe vpon it. For it is called a banket or a ſupper by way of an alluſion, which,<note place="margin">Sadeel contr. Tu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

It is well knowne that this ſecond ſacrament of the new Teſtament is called a ſupper in regard of the time when it was inſtituted: and the Supper of the Lord, becauſe it is celebrated in the Church in remembrance of the Lord Ieſus, that ordained it by his word, ratified it by his death, and deliuered it with his owne hands: wheras theſe men ſuppoſe it is called a banket becauſe we ought to vſe ſuch a geſture as is common at bankets, and a ſupper be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe wee ought to vſe ſuch a geſture as is vſuall at ſuppers which not being intended by him is a very weake ſuppoſition, collection, and concluſion. Thirdly,<note place="margin">The third an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere.</note> this argument being well waighed, will minister weapons vnto vs, to cut in ſunder the ſinewes, and as it were the heart ſtrings of it, inaſmuch as it ſheweth that what geſture ſoeuer is vſed at the one or the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, ſtandeth more vpon cuſtome then vpon conſcience; and more vpon the example of men then the commandement of God. For what is the reaſon that in Court and country, in towne and citty, they ſtand at bankets? And what is the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon that most commonly they ſit, and ſomewhere lye along at ſuppers and dinners? Is it any other then vſe and cuſtome of places, and perſons. Dare any ſay that it is vnlawfull to eate a banket kneeling, or to take our ſupper kneeling? Are wee not left at liberty with what geſture we will eate and drinke? Or may we not vſe what order we pleaſe in theſe things?</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:21092:11"/>
            <p>If then it be in it ſelfe as lawfull to kneele when we receiue our ordinary meates and drinkes euen in the action thereof, as to ſit, or to ſtand, or to lye along: how is it that many diſlike that gesture at the Sacrament, euen for this reaſon, becauſe it is a banket and a Supper? From whence I reaſon in this forme and manner from their owne ground,
<q>
                  <p>If this Sacrament be a Supper or a banket, then the geſture of kneeling is not vnlawfull, but may freely be vſed at the taking of it.</p>
                  <p>But this Sacrament is a ſupper or a banket:</p>
                  <p>Therefore the geſture of kneeling is not vnlawful, but may freely be vſed at the taking of it.</p>
               </q> The ſtrength of this reaſon ſtandeth vpon ſuch feete as them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues haue ſhaped vnto it, to wit, that ſuch gesture is neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to be vſed at this Sacrament, as is vſuall at a ſupper or a banket. If then it be left free for vs to vſe what geſture wee pleaſe, ſitting, or lying, or ſtanding, or walking, or groueling, or bending, how can they hold with any colour, kneeling to be vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfull at the Communio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>?<note place="margin">The 4. anſwer</note> Laſtly, we cannot but confeſſe that kneeling in prayer is the fitteſt geſture to expreſſe the humility of our mindes, and the maieſty of God, and the excellency of the myſteries we do partake, and our obedience to the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate.<note place="margin">Tertul. de orat. cap. <hi>12.</hi>

And heerein do the orders of the Churches differ among themſelues; in ſome places the Miniſter remoueth not,
<pb facs="tcp:21092:11"/> and the people walke: as with vs the Miniſter walketh, and the people remoue not. Now as in the preaching of the word, the Miniſter that conceiueth the prayer ſtandeth, that he may be the better heard and vnderſtood of the people whoſe voice he is to God, &amp; they kneele ioyning with him: ſo it is in the Lords Supper, the Minister ſtandeth, becauſe otherwiſe hee cannot paſſe from place to place nor dispatch that holy worke with any quicke expedition.</p>
            <p>Secondly, albeit the Miniſter onely do by liuely voice vtter the prayer, yet it appeareth by the teſtimony of the ancient, that the receiuer was alſo to ioyne with the Miniſter, and to ſay Amen,<note place="margin">Euſeb. eccleſiaſt. hiſtor. lib. <hi>6.</hi> ca. <hi>43.</hi> and in eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh <hi>42.</hi>

               <hi>He prayed that hee might receiue this moſt ſincere puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, the which thing I durſt not do, but told him that the daily Communion many times miniſtred might ſuffice him, when he had heard thankſgiuing ſounded in the Church, and he himſelfe had ſung thereunto Amen: when he had beene preſent at the Lords Table, and had ſtretched forth his hand to receiue that holy food, &amp; had communicated, and of a long time had beene partaker of the body and blood of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt.</hi> Albeit therefore the baptiſme which he had receiued were full of ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry impieties and blaſphemies, and farre vnlike that vſed in the true Church, and that hee were ſo ſore perplexed in minde

            <p>And albeit the former maner of anſwering Amen, noted by the ancient and obſerued by the people, be not preſcribed in our Liturgy as a law and commandement: yet I doubt not but it is both intended by the Church, and practiſed of euery good Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  <seg rend="decorInit">G</seg>OD euen from the beginning added vnto the preaching of the word<note n="a" place="margin">God alway gaue his ſacra<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ments to his Church.</note> his Sacramentes in the Church (as the Scripture teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth) outwardly repeſenting and viſibly offering to our ſight thoſe things that inwardly hee perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth to vs: as<note n="b" place="margin">Gen 2, 9.</note> the tree of life, &amp; the tree of knowledge of good &amp; euil in the Garden. After mans fall, when a new neceſsity was added, in regard of mans want and weakeneſſe: he teſtified his loue and ratified his Coueant by ſacrifices &amp; Ceremonies, to our firſt Parents. Hee gaue the<note n="c" place="margin">Gen. 6, 14.</note> Arke to <hi>Noah</hi> and his ſonnes, to confirme them in the promiſe which he made to them, that they ſhould not be drowned with the reſt of the world. Hee added to <hi>Abraham</hi>
                  <note n="d" place="margin">Gen. 17, 11.</note> the ſigne of circumciſion, as a ſeale<note n="e" place="margin">Rom, 4, 11.</note> of the righteouſneſſe of faith: and to the Iſraelites hee gaue the Paſſeouer, <hi>Manna,</hi> oblations, purifications, the
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:21092:17"/> brazen Serpent, the Rocke, and ſuch like ſpirituall tipes, whereby he aſſured them of the promiſe, that God for the onely ſacrifice of Chriſt wrought vpon the Croſſe, would giue to all that beleeue forgiuenes of ſinnes and euerlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing life.</p>
               <p>Now the word of God may fitly bee reſembled to wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings and euidences: and the<note n="f" place="margin">The agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t between the Word &amp; Sacraments.</note> Sacraments to ſeales which the Lord alone ſetteth to his owne letters. They are as a viſible Sermon preaching vnto vs moſt liuely the promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of God: that as the worde wee heare doth edifie and inſtruct the minde by the outward eares, ſo do the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments by the eyes and other ſenſes. Firſt then, that wee may vnderſtand the doctrine &amp; nature of the Sacraments: wee are to conſider, what the word and Sacraments haue in common, and how they agree one with another: then, what they haue peculiar and proper each to other, and how they differ one from another.</p>
               <p>The argument betweene them ſtandeth in theſe points. Firſt, both are of God, and inſtruments which the Holye Ghoſt vſeth to this ende, to make vs more and more one with Chriſt, and partakers of ſaluation: not that God needeth them, or that he is tyed vnto them, (for as he can nouriſh without meate and drinke, ſo he can ſaue without word or Sacraments:) but becauſe wee neede them, hee vſeth them when hee will, and as often as it pleaſeth him. The ſame which is publiſhed and promiſed by the worde of God, is ſignified and ſealed by the Sacraments. For they are not a deliuering of new promiſes and articles of faith, but ſeale vp ſuch as are offered in the word. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, although God vſe them as inſtruments of his grace, yet the eſpeciall working and forcible power of them, is not in them, but dependeth on God alone: ſo that wee muſt not thinke that whoſoeuer partaketh them is partaker of grace, ſaluation, forgiueneſſe of ſinnes, and euerlaſting glory, but the vertue of them floweth from him onely as from a fountaine. A man may heare the word and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue the Sacraments all the dayes of his life, and be neuer
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:21092:17"/> the better, except God change the minde, open the heart, enlighten the vnderſtanding, cleanſe the conſcience, and ſanctifie the affections to his glory.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, as the preaching of the word profiteth nothing vnleſſe it be vnderſtood, applied, and receiued, but<note n="g" place="margin">Heb. 4, 1.</note> ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth to iudgement: ſo the Sacraments, except wee bring the hand of faith with vs, cannot giue vs faith nor grace, but tend to our condemnation. Yet, as the Goſpell is alwaies the ſauour of life vnto life of it owne nature, and the<note n="h" place="margin">Heb. 4, 12.</note> word liuely and of comfortable operation, howſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer the vnfaithfull turne it to be the ſauour of death vnto death: So the Sacraments ceaſe not in themſelues to bee true Sacraments, although they bee adminiſtred by vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy Miniſters, and receiued by vnfaithfull people. For mans wickedneſſe cannot peruert, much leſſe euert the nature of Gods ordinance. Laſtly, as the beſt ſeede ſprin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth not vp and bringeth not fruit ſo ſoone as it is ſowne, but lyeth a time couered in the earth to take rooting: ſo the fruite reaped by the word, and benefit receiued by the Sacraments preſently appeareth not, but groweth and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſeth at the time appointed of God, who will bleſſe them in his elect, at what ſeaſon himſelfe hath ordained.</p>
               <p>Thus wee ſee what the word and Sacraments haue in common; both are inſtruments of the ſame grace, both haue their benefit, bleſsing, and force depending on God, both require faith to bee mingled with them, without which they are vnprofitable; and laſtly, they profite not by and by at the ſame moment they are publiſhed, admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtred, heard, or receiued: but God afterward worketh oftentimes by them in his children to their great comfort, when all fruite to come by them ſeemed to be buried. The Diſciples at the firſt vnderſtood no more of Chriſts reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection then the vnbeleeuing <hi>Iewes</hi> did, when hee ſaide,<note n="i" place="margin">Iohn 2, 19.</note>

                     </gap>ll builde it againe in three dayes:</hi> But they lay it vp in their hearts, and long afterward re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member the words he ſpake vnto them.</p>
               <p>So whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they ſaw Chriſt riding to <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> the multitude
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:21092:18"/> ſpreading their garments in the way, and cutting downe branches<note n="k" place="margin">Mat. 21, 8.</note> from the trees, the Citty moued, and Children crying in the Temple, <hi>Hoſanna</hi> to the Sonne of <hi>Dauid:</hi> they<note n="l" place="margin">Iohn 12, 16.</note> vnderſtood none of thoſe things at the firſt: <hi>But when Ieſus was glorified, then remembred they that theſe things were written of him, and that they had done ſuch things vnto him.</hi> If then at the preſent time of our hearing or recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing, we finde not, nor feele the fruite and comfort we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire: let vs not doubt and deſpaire<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but waite on God, who in his owne apointed times will make his owne or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances auaileable to all his ſeruants. Thus much of the things that are common to the word and Sacraments.</p>
               <p>In the next place let vs ſee<note n="m" place="margin">Difference betweene the word and ſa<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>craments.</note> what they haue proper &amp; peculiar, and ſo differ one from another. Firſt, foraſmuch as the Sacraments are appurtenances and dependances to the word, and are applied to this end to ſeale vp our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with Chriſt, &amp; our fellowſhip one with another: it appeareth that in men of riper yeares the teaching and hearing of the word preached, and the open confeſsion and profeſsion of faith did go before participation of the Sacraments, as <hi>Math.</hi> 28.<note n="n" place="margin">Mat. 28, 19.</note> 
                  <hi>Goe teach all Nations,</hi> that is, make them Diſciples of Chriſt, gaine them to the faith (as the word ſignifieth) and then baptize them. Thus <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lip</hi> taught the <hi>Eunuch</hi> before hee baptized him, <hi>Acts</hi> 8. to whom when the <hi>Eunuch</hi> ſaid, <hi>What letteth mee to be bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed? Philip</hi> anſwered, <hi>If thou beleeueſt with all thine heart, thou maieſt:</hi> and he ſaid, <hi>I beleeue that Ieſus Chriſt is the Son of God.</hi> And Acts 10. <hi>Can any forbid water that theſe ſhould not be baptized, which haue receiued the Holy-Ghoſt as well as we?</hi> Indeede touching childrens baptiſme, there is ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther eſpeciall reſpect to be had, of which we ſhall ſpeake afterward: But touching others, this is the 1. difference betweene them, that whereas the word was offered euen to ſuch as were out of the Church not hauing heard of the name of Chriſt, and none excluded or debarred from the hearing of it, whether beleeuers or vnbeleeuers, holy, or prophane, Iew or Gentile, Barbarian or Schythian. 1, C. 14
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:21092:18"/> 
                  <hi>No perſon being an vnbeleeuer or Infidell, was euer admitted to the Sacraments, although he ſhould offer himſelfe</hi> (for that had beene to <hi>giue</hi>
                  <note n="t" place="margin">Mat. 7, 6.</note> 
                  <hi>that which is holy to Dogges, and to caſt pearles before Swine</hi>) but ſuch only as were inſtructed in the faith, and had made publike confeſsion thereof as members of the Church. Another difference is in the neceſsity, end, and vſe aſwell of the one as of the other. The preaching of the word is the ordinary meanes and inſtrument of the Holy-Ghoſt to beget and begin faith in vs (except God doe deale extraordinarily, which of vs is not to be looked for) and none hath entrance to Chriſt but by faith: ſo that men, if they will be ſaued, muſt heare it. But the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments are of another nature, they cannot ingender faith in vs: we muſt bring faith with vs, leaſt we partake them vnworthily, ſo that hee which beleeueth, and could not come to the Sacraments, is yet partaker of ſaluation. Wherefore the neceſsity of them is not ſimply and abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely ſo great, that without exception a man cannot bee ſaued without them: for it is the contempt, not the want of them that bringeth danger and damnation. Thirdly, it may ſometimes fall out, that in a viſible Church, the word preached may be found (as an eſſentiall note of the Church) without the Sacraments, and yet be a true Church of God: ſo that the word may be without the Sacraments, but the Sacraments cannot be without the word, as a wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting may bee without a ſeale, but not the ſeale without the writing; ſet a ſeale to a blanke, and it is vaine, voyde, and vnprofitable. Laſt of all, the preaching of the word rouſeth and affecteth onelye one of the ſenſes, to wit, the eares, wee ſee it not, wee touch it not, wee handle it not, only wee heare the ſound thereof: but the Sacraments are offered to the eyes as well as to the eares, ſo that wee doe eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> behold Ieſus Chriſt as it were crucified before vs, nay they moue and ſtirre vp the reſt of the ſenſes, whereby wee may vnderſtand what they bring, to what ende they ſerue, and how they doe auaile vnto our faith, making vs after a ſorte to handle Chriſt with our hands, and
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:21092:19"/> to ſee him with our eyes, to taſte him and touch him with our whole body. Wherefore, they do<note n="u" place="margin">How the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments are more effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all then the word.</note> more ſeale vp then the word, not that God is more true of his promiſe when he worketh by ſignes, then when he ſpeaketh by his word: but in reſpect of the manner of teaching and receiuing, becauſe by his Sacraments hee repreſenteth his promiſes as it were painted in a Table,<note n="a" place="margin">Horat. lib. de arte pocti. Seg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius irritant animos, demiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſa per aures, quam quae ſunt oculis ſubiecta fidelibus, &amp;c.</note> and ſetteth them foorth liuely as in a picture before our eyes, that we may not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly heare, but ſee, handle, touch, taſte, and euen digeſt them. Againe, the promiſe of the Goſpel is more effectually de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared and ſealed vp by the Sacraments then by the bare word, not for the ſubſtance and matter it ſelfe, but for the manner of working which is heere full, perfect, and more effectuall: ſo as that which wee perceiue and receiue by many ſenſes, as hearing and ſeeing, is more ſure and cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine then that which is diſcerned by hearing onely.</p>
               <p>Hitherto of the agreements and differences betweene word and Sacraments, and we haue ſhewed that ſo ſoone as God gaue his word, immediately he ſeconded the ſame with his Sacraments. The vſes which wee are to make <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Vſe </seg>1</label> heereof, are theſe. Firſt, ſeeing God contenteth not him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe with the word onely, but addeth the Sacraments in all ages and times of the Church, which proceedeth part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly through his owne goodneſſe, and partly through mans weakeneſſe: we ought to bee ſo farre from deſpiſing the Sacraments, that contrary-wiſe we muſt confeſſe the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefite, vſe, and worthineſſe of them can neuer be ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently magnified, and commended, nor they with ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent reuerence be receiued. Wee are dull to conceiue his promiſes, &amp; ſlow to remember them, we are full of doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting &amp; vnbeleefe: we are like to <hi>Thomas</hi>
                  <note n="b" place="margin">Iohn 20, 25.</note> one of the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, we will not beleeue them vntill in ſome ſort we ſee them, &amp; in ſome meaſure feele them in our hearts. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God hath ordained theſe myſteries and holy actions, to keepe in continuall memory his great benefits beſtow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed vpon man, to ſeale vp his promiſes, and as it were to offer vnto our ſight thoſe things which inwardly hee per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formeth
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:21092:19"/> to vs, and thereby ſtrengtheneth and increaſeth our faith through the working of his Spirit in our ſoules. An houſe, the more props and poſtes it hath to ſuſtaine &amp; ſupport it, the more weake and ruinous it is; whereas if it were ſtrong enough, it needed nothing to beare it vp: e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen ſo, ſeeing God contenteth not himſelfe with beſtow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing vpon vs, and bleſsing of vs with his word, but giueth vnto vs together with his word his holy Sacraments alſo, ſo that our faith is not onely vnderſet with the one, but vnderpropped with the other, it ſerueth to lay before our eyes our weakeneſſe, our diſtruſt, and our vnbeleefe. For if we had fulneſſe and perfection of faith, we ſhould haue no neede eyther of the worde or Sacraments: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore when this world ſhall haue an end, the miniſtry of the word ſhall ceaſe, and the adminiſtration of the Sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts ſhall be aboliſhed.</p>
               <p>Seeing, then the word is not ſufficient, but the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments were added for further aſſurance: wee muſt in this behalfe conſider the great goodneſſe of God towards vs, who doth not onely giue vs faith by his word as by his ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing inſtrument, but hath alſo added to his word, Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments or ſeales of his promiſe and grace, that by the law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full vſe of them he might vphold and ſtrengthen our faith through his bleſſed Spirit. For in aſmuch as the Lorde not onely ſent the bleſſed ſeede, for the redemption of mankinde, for the remiſsion of our ſinnes, and for the bru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of the Serpents head, but ordained for vs Sacraments to bee pledges of his promiſes, teſtimonies of his faithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and remedies of our diſtruſtfulneſſe: we muſt freely confeſſe and thankfullye acknowledge the bottomleſſe depth of Gods endleſſe mercy towards vs, who vouchſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feth to be our God, to be reconciled to vs being vile and miſerable ſinners, to make a league &amp; couenant with duſt and aſhes, and deliuer his onely Sonne to ſuffer the ſhame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full death of the Croſſe for vs. And withall wee muſt <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bor more and more to feele our owne blindneſſe, diſtruſt, infidelity, and peruerſe nature; wee would eaſily forget
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:21092:20"/> this mercy of God vnleſſe it had beene continually repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented before our eyes.</p>
               <p>Againe, ſeeing nothing is offered and giuen in the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Vſe </seg>2</label> which is not publiſhed in the Goſpell, ſeeing they cannot bee where there is no word, and ſeeing the ſame Chriſt with all his benefits is propounded in both: it meeteth with a common corruption and lamentable practiſe among many profeſſors, that deſire and craue, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially in ſickneſſe and extremity, often to come to the Lords Table, but eſteeme little of the preaching of the word, and that ſeeme to languiſh with a longing after the Sacrament, but neuer mourne and lament for want of the word: which is as great an error and madneſſe, as if one ſhould euer looke vpon the ſeale of his writings, but ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer regard the conueiance of his eſtate. Is there not one God, the author of both? Is there not one Spirite, that ſealeth vp his promiſes by both? Is Chriſt deuided; that ſpeaketh euidently vnto vs in both? How is it then, that many deſire the Sacrament of the Lords ſupper, &amp; ſeeme to pine away through want thereof, who neuer wiſh or regard the preaching of the Goſpell, which is the foode of the ſoule, the key of the Kingdome, the immortall ſeede of regeneration, and the high ordinance of God to ſaue thoſe<note n="c" place="margin">Ro. 1, 16, and 10, 14.</note> that beleeue? And whence proceedeth it, but from palpable ignorance in the matters of God and their owne ſaluation, to be much troubled that the Sacrament is not brought vnto them, and yet neuer couet to haue a worde of comforte ſpoken to them in due ſeaſon. Let all ſuch perſons vnderſtand, that as the Miniſter<note n="d" place="margin">Acts 15, 21, and 19, 4, and 2, 42, 40.</note> is charged from God to teach euery Sabboath day, and to preach the word in ſeaſon and out of ſeaſon: to deale the bread to the hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry, and to giue vnto euery one in the family his portion: ſo is it required of all the people to deſire the ſincere milk of the word of God that they may grow thereby; which, howſoeuer it bee to them that periſh, fooliſhneſſe; yet to ſuch as are called,<note n="e" place="margin">1 Cor. 1, 24.</note> it is the wiſedome of God and the power of God.</p>
               <pb n="9" facs="tcp:21092:20"/>
               <p>Thus <hi>Origen,</hi> a man excellently learned, &amp; among the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cients one of the moſt ancient, ſaith, <hi>When yee receiue the Lords ſupper with al heed &amp; reuerence, ye take heed that no ſmal peece fal fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> it by negligence to the ground: how the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> do you think it is a matter of leſſe heinous offence to neglect his word then his body?</hi> Wherby we ſee in the iudgement of this Father and Doctour of the Church, the loſſe of the word is as great a want as the loſſe of the Sacrament, and the neglect of the word is as high an offence as the neglect of the Sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, for aſmuch as one God is the author of them both, and the worker by them both.</p>
               <p>Wherefore, we are deceiued if wee make account that there is leſſe danger in neglecting the word of God, then in neglecting the Sacrament of his laſt ſupper: but wee muſt take heede, that while wee willingly deſire the one, wee doe not wilfully deſpiſe the other. For wee muſt carefully conſider, that as the Sacrament is a viſible word, ſo the worde is a ſpeaking Sacrament: and as God lifteth vp his voice vnto vs in the one, ſo hee reacheth out his hand vnto vs in the other. Wee muſt as well heare when hee calleth, as receiue when hee offereth. Now by his word preached, hee calleth: by his Sacraments admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtred, hee offereth his graces vnto vs: and, as wee muſt haue hands ſtretched out for the one, ſo wee muſt haue eares opened for the other.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, ſeeing the Sacraments are ſo neerely linked to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, <label type="milestone">

               <p>Woe vnto all them that vnioyne and put aſunder thoſe

For as it is a counterfeit repentance to leaue one ſinne, and cleaue to another: ſo it is a fai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned holineſſe to follow one ordinance of God, and to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit or forſake another. True repentance ſtandeth in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nying of all ſinne: and true religion conſiſteth in practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of all good things of God. Among many that are often hearers of the worde, you ſhall not finde many that are often receiuers of the Supper of the Lord. Theſe are like vnto <hi>Ahaz,</hi> mentioned in the Prophet <hi>Eſay,</hi> when God offered vnto him a ſigne, and bad him, <hi>aske it eyther in the depth,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Eſay 7, 11.</note> 
                  <hi>or in the height aboue,</hi> to ſtrengthen his faith, and aſſure him of the promiſe of God, hee neglected and contemned the ſame, through prophaneneſſe of heart, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit he anſwered in words, hee would <hi>not tempt the Lorde:</hi> This man is worthily branded in the Scripture with the note of a wicked man:<note place="margin">Verſe 12. 2 Chron. 28, 22.</note> and hath it ſet vpon him as a mark whereby he may be knowne, for aſmuch as in refuſing to receiue a ſigne, beſide all his other ſinnes, he breaketh out into many ſinnes, and ſheweth his contempt, vnthankful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, hatred, pride, infidelity, and hypocriſie. So it is with ſuch as liue among vs,<note place="margin">What ſinnes they commit that neglect the vſe of the Sacraments.</note> and loue not to come to the Table of the Lord. Firſt, they are diſobedient to God, &amp; refuſe to doe that which hee commandeth them to doe. They contemne the miniſtry of thoſe whome God hath ſent to offer vnto vs the ſeales of his loue, the aſſurances of his promiſes, and the pledges of our ſaluation. To rebel againſt God is no ſmall ſinne, and to deny openly without feare and without ſhame to obey his will.</p>
               <p>Secondly, ſuch as abſent themſelues from the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments are moſt vnthankefull vnto God, who ſpareth our weakeneſſe, and offereth vnto vs wholeſome ſtayes, as it were firme and ſtrong pillars to vphold our faith. Such as haue the greateſt and ſtrongeſt faith, and haue attained to the higheſt meaſure of aſſurance, doe yet in this life
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:21092:21"/> ſtand as much in neede of the Sacraments, as a ruinous building doth of ſhores and ſupporters, or a weake body doth of meat and nouriſhment.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, they are guilty of the greeuous ſinne and hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible crime of hatred againſt God, becauſe like to <hi>Ahaz</hi> as much as lyeth in them, they would haue the glory of God darkened, that it might not ſhine, and the truth of God buried, that it might not appeare in the performance of his promiſes. If theſe men were perſwaded in their hearts, that the neglect of the Sacraments is a ſecret ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred againſt God, and an vniuſt detaining from him the praiſe and honour that is due to his great name, they wold make more conſcience of this ſinne then commonly they doe.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, ſuch as come not vnto them with feare and reuerence, are poſſeſſed with ſpiritual pride and preſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which is a dangerous diſeaſe, and ſo much the more dangerous, by how much it is the leſſe eſpied. For theſe men do imagine they haue ſtrength of faith, greater then indeed they haue: and in that high and haughty conceit of their owne guifts, doe contemne the vſe of the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, as neede-leſſe and ſuperfluous things: Theſe are they that ſay they are rich, and haue need of nothing, and yet know not that they are wretched and miſerable, and poore, and blinde, and naked: theſe are heart-ſicke and yet feele it not, and are neere without ſpeedy repentance vnto condemnation. For as the ſicke man that refuſeth wholeſome medicines &amp; ſoueraigne preſeruatiues, increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth his diſeaſe, and draweth death willingly and wilful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly vpon himſelfe: ſo ſuch perſons as regard not the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, which god (as the ſpiritual Phyſition of our ſoules) offereth vnto vs, as meanes to reſtore vs and recouer vs from the venemous poiſon of vnbeleefe, which wee haue drunke from our firſt parents, doe by little and little har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den themſelues, and iuſtly periſh in the euill way.</p>
               <p>Fiftly, they bewray their infidelity, and an euill per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſion of the truth &amp; power of God, as <hi>Ahaz</hi> did when
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:21092:22"/> he refuſed the ſigne which of his grace and goodnes was offered vnto him. He ſaide, he would <hi>not aske a ſigne neyther tempt God;</hi> but becauſe he asked not a ſigne, therefore he tempted God. So doe all they that refuſe to helpe the weakeneſſe of their faith by the vſe of the Sacraments, they tempt God, and make tryall whether hee will ſaue them, or can ſaue them, without thoſe ordinary meanes that he hath ordained. This is a true and certaine rule, that all they which haue faith will bee carefull to ſtreng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then their faith: ſuch as haue no faith at all, regard not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny meanes whereby they may obtaine faith; as they that haue life in them ſeeke to ſuſtaine it, but the dead ſtirre not hand or foote.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, ſuch perſons as care not to be preſent at the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments, haue their hearts poſſeſſed with hypocriſie and deepe diſsimulation, and do indeed and in truth, no bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter then mocke God and godlineſſe. They profeſſe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues to be deſirous to know God, and to ſerue him with a perfect heart, and with a willing minde, in aſmuch as they are partakers of the worde; howbeit, becauſe they regard not to reſort to his Table, and to ſit downe with him as his gueſts: they are farre from that truth and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward ſincerity that ought to be in all the ſeruants of God. Thus then we ſee how many ſinnes do concurre and meet together, in all ſuch as doe not conſtantly and conſciona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly frequent the Sacraments, which muſt be duely conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered of vs, leaſt by heaping vp all theſe ſins in the necke one of another, wee alſo bring downe from heauen vpon our heads many puniſhments and plagues, according to our iuſt deſeruings. For inaſmuch as the Lord not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſent the bleſſed Seede for the redemption of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kinde, for the remiſsion of ſinnes, and for the bruſing of the Serpents head, but ordained for vs Sacraments to bee pledges of his promiſes, teſtimonies of his faithfulneſſe, and remedies of our diſtruſt; we muſt confeſſe and thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully acknowledge the bottomeleſſe depth of his mercy towards vs, who vouchſafeth to bee our God, to bee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:21092:22"/> vnto vs being vile &amp; miſerable ſinners, to make a league and couenant with duſt and aſhes, and to deliuer his onely ſonne to ſuffer the bitter death of the ſhamefull Croſſe. And withall wee muſt confeſſe, and labour more and more to feele our owne blindnes, and infidelity, which mercy we would eaſily forget, vnleſſe it had beene conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually repreſented before our eyes.</p>

                  </note> whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther a thing be, before we conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der what it is. We haue heard be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, that there are Sacraments &amp; euer haue beene in the Church of God. Now then let vs conſider what they are, that firſt the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter handled, may be defined. For in vaine we ſhall rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon and ſpeake of the Sacraments, vnleſſe we vnderſtand what a Sacrament is. But before wee ſet downe any de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription of it, it ſhall not bee amiſſe to ſpeake ſomewhat of the word. The name in ſo many letters and ſillables, is not indeed in the Scripture, no more then the worde Trinity, catholike, Conſubſtantiall, and ſuch like: which being now generally receiued, is not to be reiected, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the doctrine contained vnder it, agreeth with the Scripture, and nothing thereby is added to the Scripture. Now as the fathers of the Greeke Church called theſe ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly rites by name of Myſteries, becauſe the ſubſtance of them was onely knowne to the members of the Church, and hidden from others: ſo the ancient teachers of the Latine Church, called them Sacraments, in reſpect of the affinity and neereneſſe betweene them and a Sacrament. For a Sacrament properly is that ſolemne oath in warre, by which Souldiers bound themſelues to their chief Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine.
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:21092:23"/> Such a regard had the olde Romanes in the diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline of their warres, that it was<note n="d" place="margin">Cicero de of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fic. Lib. <hi>1.</hi>
                  </note> not lawfull for any to kill an enemy, or enter into the battell to fight, vnleſſe he were ſworne a Souldier. So when wee are partakers of theſe holye ſignes which God hath appointed in his Church, by which he beſtoweth vpon vs ſpirituall guifts,<note n="e" place="margin">A Sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t properly is the Souldiers oath: meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phorically the Churches band binding them to God.</note> we do bind our ſelues to him, we profeſſe openly his true religion, we vow to fight vnder his banner againſt our e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>n<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>mies: ſo that they are teſtimonies and tokens of the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenant betweene God and vs, that he is our God, and we binde our ſelues to bee his people, to ſerue him and no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther God. So circumciſion was a ſeale of Gods promiſe to <hi>Abraham,</hi> and a ſeale of <hi>Abrahams</hi> faith and obedience toward God. By them man is bound to God, and God vouchſafeth to binde himſelfe to man. Wherefore, the word Sacrament, being tranſlated from the campe to the Church, from a Souldier to a Chriſtian, from a ciuill vſe to an holy, let vs ſee in this ſence and ſignification what it is. Now, the word beeing borrowed from warres, is<note n="f" place="margin">A Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red 2. wayes.</note> taken two waies: firſt in a generall ſignification, and may com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend all manner of ſignes, whether naturall, or mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous, or voluntary, which God commanded men to vſe, to aſſure them of the vndoubted truth of his promiſe: as when hee gaue to <hi>Adam</hi> in the Garden, the tree of life to bee a pledge of his immortality, the Raine-bow to <hi>Noah</hi> and his poſterity; ſometimes hee gaue them miraculous ſignes, as light in a ſmoaking Furnace to <hi>Abraham;</hi> the fleece wet, the earth beeing drye, and the earth wet, the fleece beeing drye, to <hi>Gedeon:</hi> to promiſe and performe victory to <hi>Gedeon.</hi> In this large acceptation of the worde, we doe not intreate of the Sacraments: wee ſpeake pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly of thoſe, which God hath left to be ordinary in his Church, to bee ſeales of our communion with Chriſt, and of the righteouſneſſe which is by faith. A Sacrament<note n="g" place="margin">What a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament is.</note> thus conſidered is <hi>a viſible ſigne and ſeale ordained of God, wherby Chriſt and all his ſauing graces by certaine outward rites are ſignified, exhibited, and ſealed vp vnto vs.</hi> In this deſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:21092:23"/> wee are to conſider theſe 3. things. Firſt the whole kinde or generall: ſecondly, the cauſe or author thereof: and laſtly the vſe of this doctrine deliuered. Touching the firſt, whereas it is ſaide that a ſacrament is a viſible ſigne and ſeale, this is prooued and confirmed in ſundry places of the ſcripture, as <hi>Gen.</hi> 17. ſpeaking of circu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ciſion, (he ſaith)<note n="h" place="margin">Gen. 17, 11.</note> 
                  <hi>It ſhall be a ſigne of the couenant betweene me and thee.</hi> And <hi>Ro.</hi> 4. ſpeaking of <hi>Abraham</hi> (he ſaith)<note n="i" place="margin">Rom. 4, 11</note> 
                  <hi>He receiued the ſigne of circumciſion as a ſeale of the righteouſneſſe of faith.</hi> Indeede a ſigne and a ſeale differ one from another, as the generall from the eſpeciall: for euery ſeale is a ſigne, but euery ſigne is not a ſeale. A ſeale certifieth, aſſureth, and confirmeth a thing: a ſigne onely ſheweth it: but a Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment doth both. It is a ſigne to ſignifie and repreſent: a ſeale to ratifie and aſſure: an inſtrument to conferre and conueigh Chriſt with all his benefits to them that truely beleeue in him: a pledge vnto vs of Gods promiſes: a vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible word, and as a notable glaſſe wherin we may behold<note n="k" place="margin">Auguſt de doct. Chriſt. lib. <hi>2.</hi> Cap. <hi>1.</hi>
                  </note> aſſured teſtimonies of Gods eternall fauour, and of the abundant riches of his grace which hee beſtoweth vpon vs. This teacheth vs to acknowledge, there is more in the Sacraments then is ſeene with the eyes, or felt with the hands: and therefore we muſt not conceiue vnreuerently of them, nor come negligently vnto them, making them meere carnall and outward things: but wee muſt thinke reuerently, ſpeake ſoberly, receiue humbly and penitent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly theſe holy myſteries. Againe, hereby we are brought to beleeue the promiſes of God: for if the Sacraments be not onely ſignes of his fauour but ſeales of our faith, can wee doubt of his mercy and good meaning toward vs, hauing left ſuch pawnes and pledges thereof with vs, that wee might haue aſſured comfort and comfortable aſſurance of ſaluation and eternall life? Is it not among men matter of aſſurance, and a note of true dealing, to haue a pledge left with vs? But behold God hath left vnto vs two pawnes of his promiſes, as it were an earneſt-penny, that our faith ſhould not wauer. If then his alone worde bee al-ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient, hauing a noble addition of the Sacraments,
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:21092:24"/> as of his ſeales, let vs beleeue his promiſes, and in all ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations reſt vpon them with all confidence and conſolati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
               <p>Secondly it is ſaide<note n="l" place="margin">Sacraments were inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ted o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> God alone.</note> a Sacrament is a diuine ordinance. Not any Angell or Arch-angell, not any Prince or Poten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate, but onely God himſelfe is the author and ordainer of all holye ſignes and Sacraments. This appeareth by many witneſſes out of the worde of God, <hi>I haue ſet my bow in the cloud, and it ſhall bee for a ſigne of the couenant be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene mee and the earth: and when I ſhall couer the earth with a cloud, and the bow ſhall be ſeene in the cloud, then will I remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber my couenant which is betweene me and you.</hi> Where wee ſee, that when God determined to bee mercifull vnto the world, and neuer to drowne the ſame with water againe as he had drowned it, he gaue them a ſigne of his promiſe, to wit, <hi>His bow in the clouds.</hi> When God would witneſſe and ſtabliſh to <hi>Abraham</hi> and his ſeede after him the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe of his mercy, hee ordained a Sacrament to confirme the ſame, <hi>Gen.</hi> 17. <hi>This is my couenant which ye ſhall keepe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene me and you, let euery man child among you be circumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed.</hi> And the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>I haue receiued of the Lord that which I haue deliuered vnto you.</hi> And Chriſt himſelfe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted Baptiſme, and ſent forth his Diſciples to preach the Goſpell. All theſe teſtimonies as a cloud of witneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes doe confirme vs in this truth, that none hath power &amp; authority in the Church to inſtitute a Sacrament, but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly God. And the reaſons are apparant: Firſt, the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments belong to the ſeruice and worſhip of God: now it reſteth not in man to appoint and preſcribe a ſeruice of God, but to retaine and imbrace that which is taught by him, <hi>For in vaine they worſhip him, teaching for doctrines mens precepts.</hi> Againe, the Sacramentall ſignes haue Gods promiſes annexed vnto them, confirming vs in the ſame, which they could not doe, but by the bleſsing and benefit of him that promiſeth: ſo that God onely is able to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtow grace, and he alone can appoint true ſignes of grace. For as he onely hath authority to ſeale the charter &amp; par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:21092:24"/> in whoſe iuriſdiction it is to grant it: ſo likewiſe God giueth the pledges and tokens of his grace which ſheadeth the graces of the Spirite into our hearts. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, the reuerent Sacraments of the Church, none can in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitute by his authority, but onely God: and hence it is, that the ſignes haue the names of the thinges ſignified. None but Chriſt himſelfe could ſay of the bread, <hi>This is my body:</hi> none but hee could ſay of the cup, <hi>This cup is the new Teſtament in my bloud:</hi> none but hee, breathing on his Apoſtles could ſay, <hi>Receiue the Holy Ghoſt:</hi> none but hee could make the water in Baptiſme to be the lauer of rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration.</p>
               <p>Let vs ſee what good and profitable vſes ariſe from this <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Ʋſe </seg>1</label> doctrine. Firſt, if the Sacraments bee the ordinances of God, then they depend not on the worthineſſe or vnwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thineſſe, fitneſſe or vnfitneſſe vices or vertues of the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter: but all their efficacy and force hangeth on the holy inſtitution of Chriſt Ieſus. The Miniſters impiety &amp; wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedneſſe maketh not a nullity of the Sacrament, neyther hindereth the fruite of the worthy receiuer, no more then the piety and godlineſſe of a faithfull Miniſter can profite an vnworthy receiuer. Indeede, the Church muſt inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour that they bee cleane which beare the Veſſels of the Lord, Eſay 52, 11. and that the Miniſters thereof may bee holye and vnblameable, according to the Apoſtles<note n="r" place="margin">1 Tim. 3, 2.</note> rule, but we muſt not meaſure the profit of the receiuer, by the perſon of the Miniſter. If a theefe do ſteale a ſack of corne, we ſee if he ſow it, it groweth vp and bringeth foorth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe, becauſe the fault reſteth not in the ſeede which is good, but in the ſower which is euill: ſo doth the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment profite the faithfull, howſoeuer hee bee vnfaithfull that doth adminiſter it. Wee ſee if the ſeede-man haue foule, filthy, and vncleane hands that ſoweth, yet if the ſeede be cleane, ſweete, and faire, it proſpereth: ſo the holy things of God<note n="ſ" place="margin">Euill Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters may deliuer the good things of God.</note> cannot be defiled by the corrupt and ſinfull life of the Miniſter, while he deliuereth nothing of his owne, but diſpenſeth the ordinances of God. Thus
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:21092:25"/> we ſee that whether the Miniſter be good or euill, godly or vngodly, an heretick or a Catholike, holy or prophane, the effect is all one, the worthines of the Sacrament de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendeth not on man, but proceedeth from God; and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore all ſuch as contemne the Sacraments of God for the ſacriledge of man, ſhal beare their condemnation whoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer they are. The two ſons of <hi>Ely, Hophni</hi> and <hi>Phinehas,</hi> were<note n="t" place="margin">1 Sam. 1, 22.23.</note> exceeding ſinners againſt the Lord, yet becauſe the people of <hi>Iſrael</hi> abhorred the ſacrifices of God, and trode his worſhip vnder their feete, the wrath of the Lord was kindled againſt the whole land, and hee denounced<note n="u" place="margin">1 Sam. 6, 11.</note> ſore iudgements againſt the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. So then, the offence of the Prieſts was no defence of the people: but as the Prieſts gaue the offence, &amp; the people tooke it, ſo God bou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> together in the ſame iudgement. So we muſt know, God will not beare the contempt of his ordinances vnder any pretence whatſoeuer of the Miniſters wickednes &amp; vnworthines: if his hand be corrupt, let thy heart be vncorrupt; though his ſins be his own, yet the Sacram. be Gods: he may miniſter co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fort to thee, tho he bring none to himſelfe: as the work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that builded the <hi>Arke</hi> prepared a means to ſaue other, but were drowned the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues, or as the bels tho they moue not themſelues, yet ſerue to bring others to the exerciſes of religion, or as the Scribes that pointed the way to the wiſe-men, but themſelues vouchſafed not to ſtep out of doores to enquire after Chriſt. The eares of corne do car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry the corne with the chaffe to be purged and cleanſed in the barne, &amp; though the chaffe be vnprofitable, yet it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiteth the corne, as the Lanthorne holdeth the candle to giue light vnto others that are the paſſengers. As gold is gold, of whomſoeuer it is giuen and receiued: ſo the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament is truely a Sacrament, whether it bee giuen of a good or euil Miniſter: ſo is it with the word of God. This appeareth by the words of Chriſt our ſauiour, Math. 23. <hi>The Scribes and Phariſies ſit in Moſes ſeate:</hi>
                  <note n="a" place="margin">Mat. 23, 2, 3</note> 
                  <hi>all therefore whatſoeuer they bid you obſerue, that obſerue and doe: but after their workes do not, for they ſay and do not.</hi> Albeit then, the Scripture condemneth ſuch as giue offences, yet ſuch as
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:21092:25"/> take offence are not thereby iuſtified; let vs magnifie the ordinances of God, and then we may expect a bleſsing at his hands. This is that which the<note n="b" place="margin">1 Cor. 3, 6, 7</note> Apoſtle teacheth. <hi>I haue planted, Apollos watered, but God gaue the increaſe: So then, neyther is he that planteth any thing, neither he that wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treth, but God that giueth the increaſe.</hi> Wherefore, the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of God notwithſtanding the wickedneſſe and vnwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thines of the Miniſters, may ſafely and with a good con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience vſe their miniſtry, both hearing the word fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> their mouths, and receiuing the Sacraments at their hands: and both of them are effectuall and auaileable vnto ſaluation, neither do they defile themſelues by their corruption. The Donatiſts in former times, &amp; the Anabaptiſts in our daies, teach that ſuch ſcandalous Miniſters as giue offence can profite vs nothing at al, nor further our ſaluation, nor doe vs any good, &amp; that being defiled themſelues by their ſins, they defile alſo the Sacraments. Heereunto they bring the ſaying in the law of <hi>Moſes, Whatſoeuer the vncleane per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon toucheth, ſhall be vncleane: &amp; the ſoule that toucheth it ſhal be vncleane vntill euen.</hi> Likewiſe they alleadge the wordes of <hi>Haggai</hi> the Prophet, <hi>If a man beare holy fleſh in the skirt of his garmant, &amp; with his skirt do touch bread or pottage, or wine, or oyle, or any meat, ſhall it be holy? The Prieſts anſwered and ſaid, No. Then ſaid Haggai, If one that is vncleane by a dead body touch any of theſe, ſhall it be vncleane? The Prieſts anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, It ſhall be vncleane: So is this people, and ſo is this Nation before me, ſaith the Lord, and ſo is euery worke of their hands, and that which they offer there is vncleane.</hi> Therefore whenſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer the Miniſters are polluted with vices, they do pollute &amp; prophane whatſoeuer they handle. I anſwere, theſe words are corrupted &amp; depraued by theſe heretikes. The Prophet ſaith not by way of application, ſo doe you pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute the Sacram. and ſacrifices of the people, but the drift of the place is to ſhew vnto vs that our works are polluted and abhominable in the ſight of almighty God, and vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly reiected of him, except they proceed from the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine of a pure heart &amp; faith vnfained: ſo that albeit they be in their nature neuer ſo good, yet if wee bee vncleane
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:21092:26"/> and vnpure, we make them all vnpure to our ſelues: I ſay, to our ſelues but not to others. For why ſhould they bear the blame of our impurity? or why ſhould they bee puni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed for our iniquity? The Apoſtle ſpeaking of the Lords Supper, 1 Cor. 11. ſaith, <hi>He that eateth and drinketh vnwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thily, eateth and drinketh iudgement to himſelfe, not diſcerning the Lords body:</hi> hee cannot eate and drinke iudgement to other men, but hee may to himſelfe. Likewiſe, the ſame Apoſtle writing to <hi>Titus</hi> ſaith, Chap. 1.15. <hi>Vnto the pure all things are pure, but vnto them that are defiled and vnbeleeuing, is nothing pure: but euen their minde and conſcience is defiled.</hi> No man can defile the Sacraments to others, but onely to himſelfe, foraſmuch as they take their nature and borrow their force from God, not from men: and therefore are not to bee eſteemed by the vice or vertue of the Miniſter, but by the power and vertue of God. If a Prince ſhould ſend vs a pardon by his letters pattens, and deliuer them into the hand of a wicked man, as God ſent <hi>Iudas</hi> the ſon of perdition to the Children of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> to preach vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that the kingdome of God was at hand: would we refuſe the pardon becauſe of the wickedneſſe of the meſſenger? Or may wee thinke it to bee leſſe forcible and auaileable, becauſe hee is an vngodly perſon? Woe then vnto thoſe that bring in againe the damnable doctrine and practiſe of the Donatiſts, long ſince buried and ſhaken in peeces, who make a ſchiſme in the Church, &amp; depart out of the church for the faults &amp; offences of the Miniſters; becauſe wee are not baptized into the names of the Miniſters, neyther are made partakers of the ſupper of the Miniſters: but we are baptized in the name of God, and we are made partakers of the Supper of the Lord. They are therefore their owne enemies, that looke too much vpon the meſſenger, and too <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Vſe. </seg>2</label> little vpon him that ſendeth him vnto vs.</p>
               <p>Secondly, is God the true and onely author and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointer of Sacraments? Then none muſt adde vnto, or take from the Sacraments inſtituted by him in the church, no more then vnto the<note n="c" place="margin">Deut. 4.</note> worde it ſelfe, <hi>Deutronomy</hi> 4. <hi>Yee ſhall put nothing to the word which I command you, neyther

When God offereth himſelfe and his graces to vs by his word and Goſpell, if we ſtop our eares and harden our hearts, it turneth to be the fauour of death to death: ſo is it in the Sacraments when wee come to them, God doth not feede our eyes with naked, vaine, and idle ſhewes, but ioyneth the truth with the outward token, and giueth the grace ſignified with the ſigne. If we bring the hand of faith with vs, which openeth the gate of the kingdome of heauen for vs, Chriſt is both offered and giuen to vs. But howſoeuer the ſigne be alwayes inſeparably ioyned with the grace that is ſignified, in reſpect of God: yet hence it followeth not that both of them are of all receiued. For the outward ſigne is offered to the hand, to the ſenſes, and inſtruments of the bodye, which becauſe all bring with them, all are partakers of the outward parts. But Chriſt who is ſignified by the ſigne, is offered to the ſoule and faith of the receiuer,<note n="m" place="margin">2.

               <p>Thirdly, if the right receiuers receiue Chriſt, and with <label type="milestone">

The vnbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeuers and vnrepentant perſons come indeed into the aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly of the faithfull, to heare the worde of God read, preached, and expounded, and as they come without faith, ſo they depart without fruite: yet their company defileth not the ſauing hearer.

But when God graciouſly pardoneth ſinne,<note n="ſ" place="margin">Ezek. 18, 22.</note> he remembreth it no more. Beſides, that which is proper to God, ought not to be aſcribed to the creature.

                  <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>E haue ſeene what a Sacrament is: now we are to conſider in it two thinges, firſt his parts, then his vſes: for in handling theſe two points, wee ſhall ſee what is the nature of a Sacrament. The parts of a Sacrament are of two ſortes, ſome outward, open, ſenſible, earthly, viſible, and ſignifying: ſome are inward, hidden, ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, heauenly, inuiſible, and ſignified. For the nature of a Sacrament is partly earthly, and partly heauenly. If wee had beene wholy a ſpirite without body, hee would giue vs his guifts ſpiritually without a bodye: but ſeeing wee are ſoule and bodye, he giueth vs his Sacraments, that ſo wee may apprehend ſpirituall guifts by ſenſible thinges. The outward part is one thing, and the inward part is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother thing: the outward is applyed to the bodye, the inward is applyed to the ſoule and conſcience. This di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſion and diſtinction of parts<note n="a" place="margin">Rom. 2<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 28.29.</note> appeareth plainely in ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry places of holy Scripture, as Rom. 2. <hi>Hee is not a Iew which is one outward, ne<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Heereunto commeth<note n="b" place="margin">Col. 2, 11.</note> that ſaying, <hi>Ye are circumciſed with circumciſion made with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out hands:</hi> ſo that there is a circumciſion without, and there is another within by the vertue of Chriſt. The ſame
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:21092:29"/> we may ſay of Baptiſme, there is a baptizing of the body, and there is a baptizing of the ſoule: the body is waſhed with water, the ſoule is clenſed by the precious bloud of our ſauiour Chriſt, which is the hidden and myſticall part of the Sacrament. This appeareth by many examples re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded in Scripture. <hi>Simon</hi> the ſorcerer, though he were baptized with water, yet his heart was not right in the ſight of God, he remained<note n="c" place="margin">Acts 8, 13, 21, 23.</note> in the gall of bitterneſſe and in the bond of iniquity, ſo that albeit hee were baptized, yet he was not regenerated. The Iſraelites were parta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers of the<note n="d" place="margin">1. Cor. 10, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.</note> outward ſignes, not of the inuiſible grace. <hi>They were all baptized vnto Moyſes in that cloud and in that ſea: they did all eate the ſame ſpirituall meate, they all dranke the ſame ſpirituall drinke, yet with many of them God was not pleaſed.</hi> The like may be ſaide of <hi>Iudas</hi> one of the twelue, he did eate the Paſcall lambe as wel as the reſt of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, but he did not eate Chriſt (who is the lambe vndefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led and without ſpot) as the other did. This is that alſo which <hi>Iohn</hi> the<note n="e" place="margin">Mat. 3, 11.</note> Baptiſt teacheth, <hi>Indeed I baptize you with water to amendment of life, but hee that commeth after mee is mightier then I, whoſe ſhooes I am not worthy to beare, hee ſhall baptize you with the Holy Ghoſt and with fire:</hi> where, as the Baptiſt maketh two baptizers, himſelfe and Chriſt, ſo hee diſtinguiſheth their actions, his owne to waſh with water, and the action of Chriſt to waſh with the Holye Ghoſt. Neither neede wee to ſeeke farre for reaſon, to perſwade any to beleeue this truth, that the nature of a ſacrament, is neither wholy outward or wholy inward, but taketh part of both; ſeeing nothing can bee a ſigne of it ſelfe, but a ſigne is a ſigne of another thing, and ſeeing they are myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, they haue an hidden meaning and ſpirituall vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding. If the water in Baptiſme had not grace an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexed vnto it, it could not be a myſtery. We ſee the ſigne, we ſee not the grace which is inuiſible. Now let vs come to the vſes.</p>

For wee muſt vnderſtand that the Scripture in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of this vnion, ſpeaketh of the Sacraments two waies, to wit, properly and figuratiuely. Properly, when that which belongeth to the ſigne is giuen to the ſigne, and when the thing ſignified is giuen and applyed to the thing it ſelfe; and thus each part hath his owne, as Circumciſion is called<note n="i" place="margin">Gen. 17, 11.</note> the ſigne of the Couenant.

                  <hi>which is ſhedde for many for remiſsion of ſinnes,</hi> we muſt vnderſtand the wordes literally as they lye. Figuratiuely, when the ſigne is gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen to the thing ſignified, and called by the name of it, as Chriſt is called<note n="n" place="margin">1 Cor. 5, 7.</note> the Paſſeouer: &amp; the<note n="o" place="margin">Ioh. 1, 29.</note> Lambe of God: his fleſh is alſo ſaide to bee meate indeede, and his blood drinke indeede: the holy Spirite is called<note n="p" place="margin">Eze. 36, 25.</note> water, or elſe the name of the thing ſignified is giuen to the ſigne, as bread is called the<note n="q" place="margin">Mat. 26, 28.</note> body of Chriſt, the cup is called the new Teſtament. Theſe ſpeaches muſt bee taken figura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiuely, and vnderſtood by a change of name according to the intention and meaning of the Holy-Ghoſt: ſo that we muſt beware that we doe not take or miſtake the ſigne for the thing, nor the thing for the ſigne, ſeeing the parts are diſtinguiſhed in nature, though ioyned in the perſon.</p>
               <p>Againe, albeit by Gods ordinance theſe parts bee ſo vnited, that by taking of the ſigne the faithfull are made partakers of the thing ſignified, no leſſe truely then the outward ſignes are receiued of our bodily ſenſes: yet wee muſt conceiue and conſider, that theſe outward &amp; inward parts remaine diſtinct and vnconfounded, and therefore
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:21092:30"/> we muſt take heed we take not one for another: we muſt not aſcribe too much to the outward parts, and ſo take them for the inward, which hath beene the occaſion of ſundry errors from time to time. Some attribute too lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle to the out-ward ſigne, and ſome aſcribe too much: both waies the Sacrament is abuſed and the parts are miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>applyed. Hence ſprang as a ranke weede in the Lords corne, the doctrine of tranſubſtantiation or carnall tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the ſubſtance of bread into the bodye, whereby the ſigne is ſwallowed vp, &amp; the outward ſubſtance with them quite aboliſhed; for their fained Chriſt hath con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed the outward ſigne, as the rich deuoureth and eateth the poore. Thus the ſigne is conſumed and too little re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded. Others on the other ſide, cleaue too much to the outward ſigne, and reſt in the externall worke, placing holineſſe and remiſsion of ſinnes in the deede done: and thus the thing ſignified is little regarded and wholy abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed,<note n="r" place="margin">Gen. 41, 4.</note> as the euill fauoured and leane-fleſhed Kine did eate vp the fat &amp; well-fauored: this was <hi>Pharaohs</hi> dream, and the other is mans deuiſe.

               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He outward partes of a Sacrament are ſuch things, as<note n="a" place="margin">What out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward parts are.</note> vnder a certaine ſimilitude and ſikeneſſe do repreſent and ſignifie heauenly thinges, to aſſure vs they are as truely pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent and offered vs, as wee behold with our eyes, and receiue with our hands the earthly things giuen vnto vs. The outward parts of a Sacrament are in num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber<note n="b" place="margin">Foure out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward parts of a Sacrament.</note> foure. Firſt the Miniſter: Secondly, the word of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution. Thirdly, the ſigne. Fourthly, the receiuer. All theſe and euery one of them are needful to the beeing and nature of a Sacrament: take them away or any of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, and you take away the ſubſtance and bring in a nullity of the Sacrament. If there be no Miniſter, no word, no e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lement, no receiuer: there is no Sacrament. If there be wanting eyther Miniſter to deliuer it or word to inſtitute it, or element to repreſent it, or receiuer to take it: wee cannot aſſure our ſelues to haue any Sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of God, but rather a tradition and inuention of our owne. In this place I take the word [part] in a generall ſence and ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, and therefore do conclude in it, and comprehend vnder it, as well the Miniſters and receiuers to bee out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward parts of a Sacrament, as the ſignes themſelues. All men do confeſſe that the ſignes are parts, becauſe they are materiall: but I vndertake to prooue the perſons both of him that deliuereth and of them that receiue to bee eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentiall alſo. Beſides, the actions of the Miniſter, and the actions of the receiuer are both of them ſignificant (as is manifeſtly ſhewed) ſo that there is a fit reſemblance be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene the workes of the Miniſter and the workes of God the Father; for God performeth the truth of that inward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly which the Miniſter doth outwardly: and the actions of
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:21092:32"/> the receiuer doe ſerue to inſtruct the faithfull what they are to doe by faith. Wherefore if the ſignes bee partes, becauſe they are ſignificant: then wee are to receiue the Miniſters and receiuers as parts alſo, becauſe whatſoeuer they do is ſignificant alſo.</p>
               <p>Firſt then,<note n="c" place="margin">The Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter is the firſt outward part of a Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</note> there is required a Miniſter lawfully cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, choſen, and ordained, hauing at the leaſt the appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation and allowance of the Church to pronounce the words of inſtitution, and to deliuer the outward ſignes to the receiuers. They are not makers of the Sacrament, but Miniſters: not authors, but adminiſtrators: not deui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſers, but deliuerers. Earthly Princes haue their letters patents, and their great ſeales, and keepers of the ſame: if another ſhall ſet to the ſeale that is not appointed the keeper thereof, is it not made an heinous crime worthy of heauy puniſhment? So the Lord is a mighty Prince, King of Kings, and Lord of Lords: he hath appointed his ſeales, to ſeale vp his promiſe of forgiueneſſe of ſinnes and eternall life: and he hath ordained his Officers as it were keepers of his great ſeales. God publiſheth ſaluation and pardon to all beleeuers by his worde as by his letters pattents, and hee addeth baptiſme and the Lords Supper as two broad ſeales for greater aſſurance and confirmati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and appointeth the Miniſters to bee keepers there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of.</p>
               <p>Whoſoeuer therefore ſhall preſume to ſet to any of theſe ſeales without warrant without a calling, without a function and direction from God himſelfe being no of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficer, no Miniſter, no keeper of them, prophaneth theſe ſeales, and ſetteth to a counterfeit ſtampe. For as no man may preach<note n="d" place="margin">Rom. 10, 15.</note> except hee bee ſent: ſo no man may admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter the Sacraments except he be called. This is it the<note n="e" place="margin">Heb. 5, 4.5.</note> Apoſtle teacheth. <hi>No man taketh this honor vnto himſelfe, but he that is called of God as was Aaron: and Chriſt tooke not to himſelfe this honor to bee made the high Prieſt: but hee that ſaide vnto him. Thou art my Sonne, this day begat I thee, gaue it to him.</hi> Now, to miniſter the Sacraments, is an honour
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:21092:33"/> in the Church, which none can take to himſelf at his own pleaſure, but God muſt giue it. They ſhould haue in their owne conſciences a witneſſe of Gods calling them to this office and honour. Wherefore the ſacred functi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons ordained of God muſt not be prophaned by volunta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry officers and vſurped offices: no man muſt take vpon him without a lawfull calling to teach theſe holy myſteries. Of theſe the<note n="f" place="margin">Ier. 23, 21.</note> Lord complaineth, <hi>I haue not ſent theſe Prophets, yet they ranne: I haue not ſpoken to them, and yet they propheſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</hi> Thus theſe intruders did thruſt their ſickle into other mens corne.</p>
               <p>The reaſons<note n="g" place="margin">Reaſons why the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters onely are to admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draments.</note> why the Miniſters and no others are to intermedle with the Sacraments, are very apparant. Firſt, becauſe euery part and member of the Church hath his e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeciall office and his proper guifts to execute his calling: we ſee in a campe, the Souldiers in warre haue their ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding-place in ſight of their captaine who hath choſen the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to be warriors: ſo in the Church muſt euery one keep his ſeuerall calling in the preſence of God, who hath in wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome and mercy called him therevnto. Wee ſee in the naturall diſpoſition of the body,<note n="h" place="margin">See Booke 2, cap. 3.</note> euery member hath his ſpeciall vſe, the eye to ſee, the hand to handle, the foote to walke, the eare to heare, and if one member ſhould in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>croach vpon the office of another, it muſt needs tend to the deſtruction of the body. We ſee in the gouernment of an houſe and family, the husband and wife, the father and ſonne, the maiſter and ſeruant know &amp; acknowledge their places to rule and to obey, to command and to bee commanded, without intruding themſelues, and incro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching vpon the function, as it were vpon the free-holde of another. If wee would aſcend a ſtep higher, wee ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerue in the affaires of ſtate and matters of the common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth, euery man doth keepe within his owne liſtes and limits, and no man dare preſume to charge any man or en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpriſe any thing in the Princes name &amp; authority, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a ſufficient warrant from the Prince himſelfe: ſo may no man take vpon him any functions in the Church, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:21092:33"/> he haue a commiſsion and commandement from the Lord. For as the Prince appointeth by what officers he will bee ſerued: ſo is it in the offices and officers of the Church, God hath placed and ordained the Apoſtle to plant, the Euangeliſt to ſecond and aſſiſt, the Prophet to propheſie, the Paſtor to feede, and hath ſet euery one<note n="k" place="margin">1 Cor. 12, 12, 14.</note> in his proper place and ſtanding as it were in his watch-tow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, out of which he muſt not wander and depart; It is a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall &amp; common rule ſet downe by the Apoſtle, <hi>Let euery man abide in the ſame vocation wherein hee was called:</hi> and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine afterwards, <hi>Let euery man wherein he was called, therein abide with God.</hi> Whoſoeuer therefore medleth without a lawfull vocation, as it were violently inuadeth another mans poſſeſsion, as <hi>Ahab</hi> did the Vineyard of <hi>Naboth:</hi> and cannot do it without the checke &amp; controlment of Chriſt Ieſus, who is the<note n="l" place="margin">Ioſh. 5, 14.</note> Captaine of his owne hoaſt,<note n="m" place="margin">Eph. 4, 15.</note> the head of his owne body, the<note n="n" place="margin">Heb. 3, 5, 6.</note> Lord of his owne houſe, and the<note n="o" place="margin">Reuel. 12, 5.</note> great King of his owne Church. Againe, Chriſt the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet and teacher of his Church, and the Prince of Paſtors, hath committed the office of adminiſtration of the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to thoſe alone to who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he hath committed the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſation of his word and preaching of the Goſpel: ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore if any other ſhall ſet to the ſeale, it is no true ſeale but a counterfeit ſtampe. The truth of this appeareth by the words of <hi>Iohn Baptiſt: Indeed I baptize with water,</hi> that is, I that am appointed a teacher in the Church, to make rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy a people prepared for the Lord. And <hi>Paul</hi> beeing con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerted and called to preach, &amp; to beare the name of God to the Gentiles, did without further word, warrant, or commandement, miniſter the Sacraments. Now then as we haue ſeene the truth of the doctrin, let vs conſider the vſes therof. Firſt, is the Miniſter of the ſubſtance of the Sacram. and a principall part of Chriſts inſtitution? Then he muſt conſider, it is his duty, being authoriſed fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> God &amp; by his Church, to ſanctifie the outward elements and adminiſter the ſame, to deliuer the outward ſignes &amp; offer the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to the receiuers. His workes therefore are to put apart &amp; conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crate the ſigns to an holy vſe, to open &amp; declare the coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:21092:34"/> of God, to pray for his bleſsing promiſed vpon his owne ordinance, to giue thanks for the bleſſed worke of our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption, to offer, giue and deliuer aright the cretures ſo ſanctified, in baptiſme to ſprinkle with water &amp; waſh the body to be baptized: &amp; in the Lords ſupper to deliuer the bread to be eaten, and the wine to bee drunke, to the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall nouriſhment of the Church. So then the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter ought not to refuſe to baptize ſuch as are broght vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him. Shall the ſeruant refuſe to doe the worke of his maiſter? When Chriſt the maiſter ſhall ſay, Goe and bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tize: ſhall he anſwere againe, I will not? when the Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turion ſaith to his ſeruant, Goe, he goeth &amp; when he ſaith Come he cometh. If the Lord keeper of the Kings broad ſeale ſhould proudly and preſumptuouſly diſdaine to ſet the ſeale to the Princes letters pattents, were he not well worthy to bee diſplaced and remoued? So if the Miniſter through enuy, or hatred, or any other ſiniſter affection, which ought not to be harbored in their breaſt, ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe to put the ſeale to the Lords Couenant, and hinder little children from comming to Chriſt, he deſerueth iuſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to be diſplaced and to beare office no longer in the cit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of God, but to be remoued for his contempt,<note n="q" place="margin">1 King. 2, 35</note> as <hi>Salo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi> put downe <hi>Abiathar.</hi>

                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Vſe </seg>2</label> Secondly, is it a neceſſary point of the Sacrament that it be miniſtred by a Miniſter? Then it condemneth all thoſe that put theſe ſeales into a wrong hand, and all priuate perſons that violently ruſh vpon this calling, and take vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them to meddle with the adminiſtration of the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments with vnwaſhen hands, ſeeing the diſpenſatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the word and Sacraments is ſo linked, annexed, and ioyned together by God, that a deniall of licence to do the one is a deniall to do the other, and contrariwiſe the licence to one is licence to the other. Chriſt neuer gaue to priuate perſons any ſuch commandement, hee neuer committed to them any ſuch office, hee neuer commended to their care theſe holy actions, he neuer called the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to this honor, he neuer laide vpon them this charge; and therefore they
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:21092:34"/> haue no part nor fellowſhip in this buſineſſe. If notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding theſe reſtrainings of authority from them, they will run and ruſh forward, where they ſhould hang backe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, their ſinne lieth at the doore, their puniſhment haſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth and their iudgement ſleepeth not.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, if the Miniſter be an outward part of the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Vſe </seg>3</label> we muſt beware and take heede wee aſcribe not to the Miniſter that which is proper to Chriſt, and ſo rob him of the honour due vnto his name. The Miniſter may of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer the ſigne, hee cannot beſtow the thing ſignified: hee may baptize the bodye, hee cannot cleanſe the ſoule: hee may deliuer the bread and wine, hee cannot giue the body and blood of Chriſt: <hi>Iohn</hi> may waſh with water, hee can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not giue the Spirite. Man indeed pronounceth the word, but God ſealeth vp his grace in the heart: man ſprinkleth the bodye with water, but God maketh cleane the ſoule by the blood of Chriſt: man may take away the filth of the fleſh, but Chriſt muſt purge the conſcience from dead works, who is that bleſſed Lambe of God that<note n="r" place="margin">Iohn 1, 29.</note> taketh a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way the ſins of the world. For as <hi>Paul</hi>
                  <note n="ſ" place="margin">1 Cor. 3, 6.</note> planteth and <hi>Apol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>los</hi> watereth, but God giueth the increaſe: ſo the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter offereth the element and outward ſigne, but God gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth the heauenly grace. It belongeth to the Miniſter to handle the externall part: it belongeth as a peculiar dignity to Chriſt to beſtow grace, to giue faith, regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,<note n="t" place="margin">Mat. 3, 11.</note> and forgiueneſſe of ſinnes, and to baptize with the Holy-Ghoſt. This truth <hi>Iohn</hi> confeſſeth, <hi>I baptize with water, but one commeth after mee, who is mightier then I, he ſhall baptize you with the Holy-Ghoſt.</hi> Where we ſee, he maketh a flat oppoſition betweene himſelfe and Chriſt, betweene his baptiſme and the baptiſme of Chriſt. As on the one ſide wee muſt take heede of the contempt of him that teacheth and miniſtreth the Sacraments, becauſe the contempt of the word &amp; Sacraments doth neceſſarily fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the contempt of his perſon: ſo we muſt beware we at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute or giue not to him more the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> his right, leſt the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of the word &amp; force of the Sacraments be attributed to
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:21092:35"/> his perſon, whereby men rob God of his glory, &amp; ſpoile themſelues of the fruite of them both. This was it where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the<note n="n" place="margin">1 Cor. 1, 22.</note> 
                  <hi>Corinthians</hi> offended, when they ſaid, <hi>I am Pauls, I am Apollos, I am Cephas, I am Chriſts.</hi> Wherefore to keepe a golden meane betweene too much and too little, we muſt doe as if a Prince ſhould ſend vs ſome preſent by one of the meaneſt meſſengers of his houſe, we would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue him fauourably and entertaine him honourably for the guifts ſake which he bringeth vnto vs: but the guift it ſelfe we would receiue for the Kings ſake, from whom it was ſent: So it becommeth euery one of vs to doe, God hath committed to his meſſengers and Miniſters the word of reconciliation, we muſt haue them in ſingular loue for their workes ſake that labour among vs, but the worde &amp; Sacraments we muſt receiue for the Lords ſake from who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they come.

               <p>Againe, when Chriſt gaue to his Diſciples the Holy-Ghoſt, hee breathed on them and ſaid,<note n="f" place="margin">Iohn 20, 22.</note> 
                  <hi>Receiue the Holy-Ghoſt.</hi> The corporall blaſt and breathing was not the Holy-Ghoſt, but he added his word and promiſe with the outward ſigne, to aſſure them that with the breathing hee beſtowed a bleſsing. Thus we ſee, that the Sacraments haue the worde alwayes ioyned with them: and without the worde, whereby their inſtitution and vſe is declared, they are as a dead bodye without life, as a dumbe ſhew without voice, as an empty cloud without water, and as a barren tree without fruite.</p>
               <p>Let vs apply this doctrine to our ſelues. Firſt it tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth, that they partake not the Sacraments aright, that
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:21092:36"/> haue not the knowledge of the word, that are ignorant both of the ordinance and inſtitution of God, and of the promiſe annexed to the inſtitution of God: of which ſort there are many in the world, that neuer labour to know what he hath appointed and commanded them to do. If they do as others of the Church do, therein they reſt and ſeeke no further to be able to warrant their owne worke. If they heare the word ſpoken, if they ſee the body waſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, the bread broken and the wine poured out, and receiue the outward ſignes, they regard no more, they go no high<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>er, they imagine that they haue done enough,<note n="g" place="margin">Vnderſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of the inſtitution, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired of all.</note> they ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer deſire to vnderſtand the meaning of the words which are neceſſary to bee knowne, comfortable to bee vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood, and profitable to be marked. If a man haue goods befallen, or legacies bequeathed vnto him by any will or Teſtament, will he not reſort to his learned counſell, to be carefull to vnderſtand the Teſtament, and know the meaning of the Teſtator? Chriſt Ieſus before his death made his will, he hath made his children heires of his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, hee promiſeth to them forgiueneſſe of ſinnes in this life, and eternall life in the world to come. Doth it not now behooue euery faithfull Chriſtian to ſearch into it, and know what is promiſed and bequeathed vnto him? Men of this world for the moſt part make their eldeſt and firſt borne heire of all, and leaue little to the other: but e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery childe of God is as the eldeſt and as the<note n="h" place="margin">Exod. 4, 22.</note> firſt borne moſt deare to him, he ſhall receiue his double portion, the ſecond ſhall haue no leſſe then the firſt, nor the third leſſe then the ſecond, nor the younger then the elder, the firſt ſhall be as the laſt, and the laſt as the firſt, for hee may doe with his owne what he liſt. Againe, if a man doe leaue all his ſonnes heyres and rich inheritors, for the moſt part leſſe is beſtowed on the daughters: but all the children of God, both his ſonnes and daughters<note n="i" place="margin">Rom. 8, 17. Gal. 4, 7.</note> ſhalbe heyres, euen the <hi>Heires of God, and heyres annexed with Chriſt Ieſus,</hi> their ſhare ſhalbe as great as the portion of Sonnes. Moreouer when a man hath paſſed all the dayes of his life in carke &amp;
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:21092:36"/> care, what can he giue to his poſterity but earthly riches, and a tranſitory poſſeſsion, a fading inheritance, leauing the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> inheritors as well of his ſorrow as of his ſubſtance? It is not ſo with the children of God. Chriſt by his laſt will and Teſtament hath promiſed to make his people ſound in faith, rich in hope, bleſſed in the pardon of their ſinnes, &amp; heires of the kingdome which hee hath promiſed to them that loue him. This is a great and vnſpeakeable comfort to all Gods children, whether high or low, whether rich or poore. So then we ought to bee much more carefull &amp; earneſt to know throughly &amp; vnderſtand perfectly the will of Chriſt, then any naturall child is to ſearch the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the wil of his natural father. And if men were not wholy carnall, they would be thus far ſpiritually minded.</p>
               <p>Againe, is the word an outward part of the Sacrament? <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Vſe </seg>2</label> Then the Sacraments muſt neuer be ſeparated &amp; ſet apart from the worde. They are not dumbe ſhewes and idle ſignes, but haue alwaies the doctrine of God adioyning vnto them, to ſhew the end, vſe, and profite of them, and the purpoſe of God in them. This appeareth in all pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, where God gaue ſignes to confirme &amp; aſſure the truth of his promiſes. When he gaue in mercy to <hi>Noah</hi> and al his poſterity the<note n="k" place="margin">Gen. 9, 11.</note> Raine-bow immediately after the flood as a ſigne of his couenant, hee addeth his word vnto the ſigne, <hi>My couenant will I eſtabliſh with you, that from hence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forth all fleſh ſhall not be rooted out by the waters of the flood, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſhall there be a flood to deſtroy the earth any more.</hi> This is it the Apoſtle meaneth, 1.

Wherefore it is no Sacrament except the worde and doctrine be ioyned vnto it, by way of explication &amp; expoſition of the outward ſigne.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, thoſe Sacraments are proued heereby to be no <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Vſe </seg>3</label> Sacraments, which are foiſted and brought in without the warrant of the word. For take away the word, and what
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:21092:37"/> is the outward Element but a bare ſigne? What is the water in baptiſme but common water? What is the bread in the Lords Supper but common bread? What is the wine but common wine, ſuch as men vſe, and all men may take at their ordinary tables? Seeing therefore ſuch ſignes and Sacraments as haue not Gods commandement for their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution: nor promiſe of grace and ſaluation annexed vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the vſing of them, are voide and nothing worth: here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the imagined and deuiſed Sacraments of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> are condemned, which deliuereth that it hath not receiued of the Lord, and impoſeth that to bee beleeued which it neuer learned in the word. Hereby the laſt an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noyling or extreame vnction is excluded, wanting the word to warrant the continuall practiſe of it. Alſo their confirmation hath neyther worde to inſtitute the practiſe, nor element ro aſſure any grace, nor promiſe to approue any vſe. True it is, they haue words to adminiſter it, but they are words of men, not of God; vnwritten, not writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten: of tradition, not of Scripture. The like might bee ſaide of mariage, though we confeſſe and acknowledge it to bee an holy ordinance and<note n="m" place="margin">Heb. 13, 4.</note> honourable inſtitution of God, yet was it made no Sacrament, hauing no word of inſtitution, no promiſe of ſanctification and ſaluation an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexed vnto all the faishfull vſers thereof: neyther is it an inſtrument, whereby God applyeth Chriſt and his ſauing benefits to the comfort and conſolation of his children.

But ſuch are their fiue pretended Sacraments of confirmation, penance, orders, matrimony, and extreame vnction, wanting eyther the word, or promiſe, or both: and therefore wee cannot re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue, we cannot acknowledge, we cannot beleeue them.

For where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer there is a Sacrament, there muſt of neceſsity be a ſigne, ſuch as water is in bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme, and bread and wine in the Lords ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, not of their owne nature, but by the ordinance of God, which are ſanctified by the eſpeciall word and pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er. Therefore, <hi>Iohn</hi> the Baptiſt baptized with water: &amp; Chriſt when he inſtituted his laſt Supper, tooke bread and brake it, and gaue it to his Diſciples: Likewiſe hee tooke the cup, wherein was the fruite of the Vine, as appeareth when he<note n="b" place="margin">Mar. 14, 25.</note> ſaide, <hi>I will drinke no more of the fruite of the Vine, vntill that day that I drinke it new in the kingdome of God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Seeing then it is cleare, there muſt in euery Sacrament be a viſible ſigne that may be ſeene and handled, let vs ſee how we may profitably apply this to our inſtruction. Firſt, ſeeing the ſignes and Sacramental rites are outward parts: we muſt take heede wee aſcribe not too much to the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward ſigne, and ſo commit idolatry to the creature. For the Water in Baptiſme hath not power in it ſelfe &amp; force to waſh away ſin, but by the ordinance of God it is made a ſigne and ſeale of regeneration. Euen as the water of <hi>Iordan</hi> where <hi>Iohn</hi> baptized, was no better then the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of others places and Countries, neyther had any ſtrength and vertue to cleanſe the Leapars that waſhed in it: yet by the bleſsing of God, <hi>Naaman</hi> the <hi>Syrian</hi>
                  <note n="c" place="margin">2 King 5, 12 14.</note> waſhing himſelfe ſeauen times therein, according to the direction of the Prophet, was cleanſed and healed of his leaproſie: So the water vſed in the Sacrament of baptiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me,
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:21092:38"/> is in nature and ſubſtance the ſame with ordinary and common water, neither hath it vigor and vertue to cleanſe the ſoule, yet by the inſtitution of God it is appointed to ſeale vp the aſſurance of remiſsion of ſinnes.</p>
               <p>Notwithſtanding, this confidence in the outward ſigne, which in it ſelfe is as nothing, hath ſince the fall of man reſted and remained in his corrupt nature, flattering him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe and deceiuing his owne ſoule. This fond and falſe opinion was in <hi>Adam</hi> immediately after his tranſgreſsio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>; he did attribute too much to the tree of life (which had in it ſelfe no more life then the reſt of the trees in the gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den) and therefore God would thruſt him out of the gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den,<note n="e" place="margin">Gen. 3, 22.</note> leaſt he ſhould beguile himſelfe with that conceite and imagination.</p>
               <p>Thus did the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> truſt too much in the Arke, a ſigne of Gods comfortable preſence and protection, attributing ſaluation thereunto, ſaying,<note n="f" place="margin">1 Sam. 4, 3.</note> 
                  <hi>It may ſaue vs out of the hands of our enemies,</hi> therefore God ouerthrew them, and gaue them into the hands of the <hi>Philiſtims.</hi> The like we might ſay of their circumciſion, they gloried much of it, and reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted altogether in it, and thought themſelues wholy diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged by it, howſoeuer they liued, and whatſoeuer they practiſed. This is the common error of the ignorant peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, they imagine they haue done God good ſeruice, and ſufficiently diſcharged their duty, when they haue beene at the Communion, albeit they know not what they haue receiued, nor how it is to bee receiued, albeit they know not nor vnderſtand the meaning of the inſtitution, nor to what end it was ordained. If they can ſay, Lord, wee haue eate and drunke in thy preſence, wee haue beene at thine owne Table, wee haue ſit downe with thee as thy gueſts, we haue beene partakers of thy Supper; they bleſſe themſelues in their owne ignorance, and thinke the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues as ſound Chriſtians as any that liue in the Church. Thus do theſe ſilly ſoules deceiue themſelues, and inſtead of the comfort of the Spirite, they heape vpon themſelues fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther damnation: if they ſee any wilfully abſtaine and and
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:21092:38"/> ſent themſelues from communicating &amp; comming to the Sacraments, they are ready to condemne them and cry out againſt them, and pronounce ſentence vpon them: how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit they neuer conſider their owne wayes, that it were better neuer to receiue the Sacrament of the Supper of the Lord, then to receiue ignorantly, brutiſhly, and vnworthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, foraſmuch as they are guilty of the bodye and blood of Chriſt. Not that any ſhould bee nouriſhed or encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged in their wilful recuſancy, but that al perſons ſhould learne to know what they do, and whereabout they goe, and wherefore they do receiue, and ſo walke in the light as children of the light, and thereby finde comfort &amp; reſt in their owne hearts.</p>
               <p>Againe, we are taught hereby, that they are no Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Vſe </seg>2</label> that haue no ſigne, no ſeale, no element to ſignify, to ſtrengthen, and to ſeale vp the promiſes of ſaluation. For as we ſhewed before, that euery Sacrament muſt haue Gods word to warrant it: ſo muſt it haue an outward ſigne to approue the receiuing of it, and to ſignifie the ſpiritual grace offered by it. Heereby we learne what to hold of tranſubſtantiation, a doctrine teaching that the bread &amp; wine is turned into the very bodye and blood of Chriſt, namely that it is a very fable to mocke fooles withall. For<note n="g" place="margin">Tranſubſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiation ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throwne.</note> whatſoeuer ouerthroweth the nature and vſe of a Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, is not to be admitted but omitted, neyther to bee receiued but reiected. But tranſubſtantiation ouerthrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth and ouerturneth both the nature and vſe of a Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: and therefore not to be admitted and receiued in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Church. For touching the nature of a Sacrament it is confeſſed,<note n="h" place="margin">Iren. lib. <hi>4.</hi> contr. haer. cap. <hi>34.</hi>
                  </note> that it conſiſteth of two parts, the one earthly and the other heauenly: but if after the words of conſecration, the bread and wine are tranſubſtantiated into the body and blood of Chriſt, then the ſigne is taken away, the element is ouerthrowne, the materiall part is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boliſhed; and conſequently the nature of a Sacrament is ouerturned. And touching the vſe of a Sacrament, there muſt be an analogy and proportion betweene the ſigne &amp;
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:21092:39"/> the thing ſignified. As in Baptiſme the element of wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter waſheth and purgeth the bodye, ſo the Holy-Ghoſt through the blood of Chriſt cleanſeth and ſanctifieth the ſoule. Likewiſe in the Lords Supper, as the Subſtance of bread and wine receiued, ſtrengtheneth and comforteth the body: ſo Chriſt<note n="i" place="margin">Ioh. 6, 33.</note> receiued by faith nouriſheth &amp; fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth the ſoule. The very true principall vſe of this Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is to confirme our faith, that as ſurely as thoſe earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly creatures taken and applyed, feed our bodies to a bodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly life: ſo the body and blood of Chriſt receiued and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed by faith, feed our ſoules to eternall life. And do not all the faithfull feele a ſweete comfort, ſo often as they come to the Lords table by this ſimilitude &amp; agreement, to conſider and know aſſuredly, that as the ſubſtance of bread ſerueth to nouriſh and doth feede our bodyes, ſo Chriſt doth feede our ſoules? But if wee muſt beleeue, that the ſubſtance of bread and wine is changed &amp; cleane gone, that nothing remaineth but accidents: where is this comfort and conſolation? How can wee bee aſſured and ſtrengthened, that as our bodies are nouriſhed with the materiall elements, ſo in like manner our ſoules by fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding on Chriſt? Wherefore, while they take away the ſubſtance of bread which ſhould nouriſh the body, the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and vſe of the Sacrament is deſtroyed, and wee are ſpoyled of the comfort of our hearts and ſtrengthning of our faith, which wee ſhould haue by this notable com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon and reſemblance of the parts. So then, if wee would receiue comfort in comming to this Communion, wee muſt retaine the ſubſtance of the ſigne, as a ſtaffe to ſtay vp our faith that it do not faile.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, ſeeing God giueth vnto vs outward ſignes of his grace, it ſerueth to teach vs, that whereſoeuer and among whomſoeuer God continueth his ſignes, he purpoſeth to beſtow vpon them the things ſignified by the ſignes: &amp; on the other ſide, where God denyeth the meanes, he alſo de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyeth the thing, &amp; whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he taketh away the ſign, he taketh away the grace alſo. This we ſee in the <hi>Turkes</hi> and <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>razins,</hi>
                  <pb n="47" facs="tcp:21092:39"/> becauſe he denyeth vnto them ſaluation, hee ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth from them the ſeales and aſſurances of ſaluation: and becauſe he refuſeth them to be his Church, hee vouchſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feth not vnto them the prerogatiues and priuiledges of his Church. Thus it falleth out in the preaching of the word: vpon thoſe whom God determineth to ſaue, and to beſtow vpon them the guift of faith, whereby they are entred into the kingdome of heauen, hee ſendeth vpon them his word and cauſeth it to be preached vnto them: but when he will not ſhew mercy, but leaue a people in their miſerable eſtate and condition, he withdraweth the Miniſtry from them, as we ſee in the Acts of the Apoſtles, Chap. 16. When they were gone throughout <hi>Phrygia</hi> and the region of <hi>Galatia, They were forbidden of the holye Ghoſt to preach the word in Aſia:</hi> and after they were come to <hi>Myſia</hi> they aſſaied to go into <hi>Bithinia, but the Spirite ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered them not.</hi> Euen as when God will bring a famine vpon a land, he with-holdeth the early and latter raine, making the heauen to be as braſſe, and the earth as iron: but when he will ſend plenty and open the windowes of heauen, he ſendeth a gracious raine and ſhowers vpon the earth: ſo when he will ſend a famine, not of bread, nor a thirſt of water, but of hearing the word of God; hee ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth away his word and the meanes of ſaluation, that they ſhall wander from ſea to ſea, and runne to and fro to ſeeke the word of the Lord, and ſhall not finde it, but faint for thirſt. If any aske the queſtion wherfore the Lord forbad <hi>Paul</hi> to preach the word in <hi>Aſia,</hi> and to come into <hi>Bythi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia;</hi> we cannot aſsigne this to be the cauſe that they were vnworthy to haue the doctrine of ſaluation offered vnto them, foraſmuch as they were as worthy as the <hi>Macedoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> to who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Goſpell was preached, &amp; no more vnwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy then the other Gentiles. Neither can we ſay this was the cauſe, that God foreſaw how euery one would receiue or entertaine the Goſpel, &amp; that as he ſaw them ready and inclined to accept of the word or to reiect it, ſo he vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſafed or not vouchſafed the ſame vnto them: for hee pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounceth
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:21092:40"/> openly, that he appeared to them of whom hee was not ſought, and ſpake vnto them that neuer asked after him. Beſides, this were to ground the cauſe of ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation vpon our ſelues, which is out of our ſelues, and to aſcribe it to our owne merite, which is due onely to his mercy. We are all by nature the children of wrath, and deſtitute of the guift of faith: if there be any willingneſſe in vs to obey, it proceedeth from the Spirite of God, who as he electeth freely, ſo he calleth freely. Now that which is ſpoken of the preaching of the word, may alſo be appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the vſe of the Sacraments. When he purpoſeth to ſtrengthen the faith which hee hath giuen vnto vs, hee vouchſafeth the outward ſignes and ſeals of his promiſes, that thereby wee ſhould be aſſured he meaneth to beſtow vpon vs the inward grace repreſented by them. He dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth iuſtly and vprightly with vs, hee hath no purpoſe to beguile vs and deceiue vs. For they are no bare or na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked much leſſe falſe and lying ſignes, but effectual inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the Spirite to conuey the mercies of God in Ieſus Chriſt into our hearts, and therefore we muſt bee carefull to vſe them conſcionably, as certaine pawnes and pled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges which God hath commended and committed vnto vs, that they might be as witneſſes of his loue and fauour to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards vs. And thus much of the third outward part, to wit, the ſigne.</p>

We vnderſtand and take heere a receiuer in generall, for euery one that commeth to the Sacrament, whether good or euill, godly or vngodly, faithfull or vnfaithfull. Such a receiuer is likewiſe a neceſſary part of the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. For no ſigne hath the ſubſtance and eſſence of a Sacrament, vnleſſe it be receiued. Though there bee a
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:21092:40"/> Miniſter to adminiſter it, a word to warrant it, a ſigne to repreſent it, yet vnleſſe there be a fit perſon to receiue it, ther can be no Sacrament. If the Miniſter ſhould ſprinkle water, and alleadge the words of inſtitution where there is no party to be baptized, this were a prophaning, not a ſolemnizing of Baptiſme: or if hee ſhould take bread and wine with prayer and thankſgiuing, where none are pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent to communicate and receiue, this were to commit ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criledge, not to deliuer a Sacrament. Wherefore, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe there be a body to be waſhed, and except there bee Communicants to partake the Supper, there can bee no Sacrament. This appeareth by the words of God vnto <hi>Abraham</hi>
                  <note n="b" place="margin">Gen. 17, 12.</note> giuing vnto him circumciſion, ſaying, <hi>Euery male childe of eight daies old ſhall bee circumciſed.</hi> This alſo appeareth in the<note n="c" place="margin">Mat. 28.19.</note> words of Chriſt ſpeaking of baptiſme, and charging the Apoſtles to baptize the nations in the name of the Father, and of the Sonne, and of the Holy-Ghoſt. Where he teacheth, that it is not ſufficient to take water, but there muſt be a waſhing. So when he ſpeaketh of his Supper<note n="d" place="margin">Mat. 26, 26, 27.</note> he ſaith, <hi>Take yee, eate ye, drinke ye:</hi> ſo that there muſt not onely be bread, but giuing, taking, and ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting: there muſt not onely be wine, but giuing, taking, and drinking thereof.</p>

This condemneth the keeping, reſeruing, holding vp, and carrying about with pompe &amp; oſtentation the Lords Supper, offering vp, kneeling downe vnto, and adoring a piece of bread: all which are horrible prophanations of that comfortable Sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, wherby the people is robbed and depriued of a precious part of their peace in Chriſt. The bread feedeth not the body, reuiueth not the ſpirits, ſtrengtheneth not the heart, by looking and gazing vpon it, by touching and handling it, but by eating, digeſting,
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:21092:41"/> and feeding vpon it: ſo doth the Sacrament ſtrengthen faith, not by reſeruing and keeping it, but by vſing and receiuing of it. For Sacraments are actions, not dumbe ſhewes. Chriſt ſaide not, <hi>Heare ye, ſee ye, gaze ye on,</hi> but <hi>Baptize ye, eate yee, drinke ye, doe yee this in remembrance of me.</hi>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">B</seg>Efore we proceed to the inward parts of a Sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, anſwerable to the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward by a fit proportion: it ſhall not be amiſſe in this place to ſpeake ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what of the Conſecration of a Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Firſt, we muſt conſider what it is: for the truth being knowne, it will caſt downe error, as the light ſcattereth the darkeneſſe. To conſecrate then<note n="a" place="margin">What con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecration is.</note> is to take a thing from the ordinary and common vſe, and to appoint it to ſome holye vſe. This therefore is conſecration, ſanctification, and dedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of the outward ſignes, to apply them vnto an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly purpoſe. This is done, partly by the Miniſter, part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by the people, and partly by them both. The Miniſter taketh the water in Baptiſme, which ſignifieth the blood of Chriſt, and he poureth it on the perſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the baptized: he taketh the bread and wine and poureth it out, he deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uereth
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:21092:42"/> them both: the people take and receiue, they eate and drinke in remembrance of Chriſt: and both Miniſter and people ioyne in prayer and thankſgiuing vnto God the Father for the myſtery of our redemption accompli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed by Chriſt our Sauiour, ſo that the Sacrament is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecrated by the whole action of the Miniſter and people together. This maketh the difference betweene common water and the water in Baptiſme: this maketh the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence betweene that bread and wine of the Supper, and the bread and wine which is vſed for ordinary meat and drinke. True it is, in nature, in eſſence, in ſubſtance there is none: but in the end and vſe. Common water wee vſe for the waſhing of our bodyes: but the water in Baptiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me is ſanctified by prayer to another vſe, to be a ſigne of the cleanſing of the ſoule. Bread and wine at mens tables in their houſes are ſet before them for the nouriſhment of their bodies: but at the Lords Table they are ordained of God to an higher and holier vſe, euen to bee ſignes of the body and blood of Chriſt. This is noted by the <hi>Euan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geliſts</hi> and by the Apoſtle <hi>Paul,</hi> that<note n="b" place="margin">Mat. 26, 26. Mar. 14, 22.

                  <hi>Euery creature of God is good, if it be receiued with thanksgiuing, for it is ſanctified by the word of God and prayer.</hi> We ſee then that Conſecration is, when a thing is ſeparated from a common and ciuill vſe to a more ſpeciall vſe,<note place="margin">Iuſtin. in Apol. <hi>2</hi>

               <p>The knowledge of this point, ſerueth to cleere our <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Vſe </seg>1</label> doctrine, &amp; to ouerthrow ſundry errors of the Church of
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:21092:42"/> 
                  <hi>Rome.</hi> Firſt, it ſheweth that we hold and teach a conſecra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that is, a ſanctifying of the water in Baptiſme, and of the bread and wine in the Lords ſupper, by the word, by prayer, and by thanksgiuing. The bread <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>d wine are changed, not in nature, but in quality: not in ſubſtance, but in vſe: not in eſſence, but in the end: not by force of certaine words, but by Chriſts inſtitution. We acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and confeſſe a conſecration, not a conuerſion: a ſanctification of the ſignes, not a tranſubſtantiatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the ſubſtance into the body and blood of Chriſt. Hee bleſſed and praiſed his Father as Mediator of the Church, for the myſtery of the redemption of mankinde: and he<note n="g" place="margin">1 Cor. 10, 16</note> bleſſed the creatures, that they might bee effectuall ſignes, and ſerue for the confirmation and increaſe of our faith.</p>
               <p>Secondly, we are taught, that conſecration is not a bare and hiſtoricall reading of the Scripture, neither a magical <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Vſe </seg>2</label> charme and incantation by force of certaine wordes, as though theſe words <hi>This is my body,</hi> being murmured and ſpoken ouer the bread, and, <hi>This cup is the new teſtament in my bloud,</hi> whiſpered ouer the wine, did fully finiſh a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecration, and made the elements to bee immediately changed into the body and blood of Chriſt, without any other obſeruing of the inſtitution. For the Lord Ieſus in pronouncing theſe words did not ſpeake to the bread or to the wine, but to his Apoſtles.</p>
               <p>And hence it is, that the forme of Chriſts giuing of thankes is not ſet downe by any <hi>Euangeliſt,</hi> becauſe our corruption and ſuperſtition is ſo great, that if wee had the words, we would aſcribe power &amp; force to the words, ſillables, and letters, &amp; therfore the manner of his thanks<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giuing is pretermitted. This inclination of the heart is apparantly ſeene in the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Church, who aſcribe effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacy &amp; operation to the pronouncing of certaine words, which is a part of ſorcery &amp; a point of witchcraft. Wheras we auouch, that the whol action of taking, breaking, pou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring out, diſtributing, eating, drinking, praying, praiſing, and rehearſing the inſtitution of Chriſt, are the conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cration,
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:21092:43"/> that is, the ſeparation of theſe creatures to this vſe.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, if after the Sacramentall actions, if after thankſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giuing to God, if after prayer that we may vſe the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures to the confirmation of our faith, there doe follow conſecration, ſanctification, and change of the elements to another vſe: then the power, effect, and working of the Sacrament dependeth not vpon the intention of the Miniſter: and therefore the<note n="h" place="margin">Concil. Trident. ſeſs. <hi>7.</hi> can. <hi>11.</hi>
                  </note> popiſh opinion is to bee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed and reproued, that holdeth it to bee no Sacrament, if the Miniſter haue not an intent and purpoſe in the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration thereof, at leaſt to do that which the church doth, that is, to conſecrate the elements and to make a Sacrament. If his mind bee not on his matters, and his heart on his buſineſſe in hand, they holde it can be no Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament. For otherwiſe ſaith <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> If a Prieſt ſhould reade the Goſpell at the table of Prelates and religious men, and in reading ſhould pronounce theſe words, <hi>This is my body, this is my bloud,</hi> then all the bread and wine vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Table ſhould bee conſecrate and changed into Chriſts body and blood: which is not ſo, becauſe his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent is wanting. Againe, if a father ſhould leade his ſon to the bath, and there dip him in the water, <hi>And ſay, I waſh thee in the name of the Father, and though he think nothing of baptizing him, yet it ſhould be baptiſme, if an intent of bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizing were not required.</hi> But I would gladly haue him an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere this queſtion: What if a father ſhould intend Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme by dipping his child in the bath, whether that were baptiſme or not? Or ſuppoſe the Prieſt we ſpake of, rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding at the Prelates table, ſhould haue a minde and mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to conſecrate all the bread and wine vpon the table, muſt it of neceſsity be a Sacrament, and reall change of al? Or admit the former Prieſt being in the ſaide Prelates wine celler, ſuppoſing himſelfe to bee in the Church and to ſtand at the Altar, ſhould pronounce the words of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecration with a purpoſe and intent to make a Sacrament, ſhould al the wine in that celler be turned into the blood
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:21092:43"/> of Chriſt? Or if he being in a Bakers ſhoppe ſhould there ſolemnely ſay, <hi>This is my body,</hi> with the foreſaide reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſhould all that bread be changed into the bodye of Chriſt? Let them ſpeake plainely, let them tell vs direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly what they hold. I thinke they will not ſay ſo: I am ſure it is not ſo. For other things are wanting, that are needfull in this matter. We haue ſhewed, that a Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is not made by bare pronouncing of certain words, aſcribing force to them after the manner of enchanters, but the whole inſtitution of Chriſt muſt be obſerued;<note n="k" place="margin">The Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth not vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Miniſter.</note> there muſt be diſtributing and receiuing, there muſt bee prayer and thanksgiuing, and from the vſe of theſe fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth Conſecration: all which are wanting in the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer examples and ſuppoſitions, there is no taking, no breaking, no diſtributing, no pouring out, no receiuing, no praying, no thanksgiuing. Wee ſee touching the word of God, with what intent and vnder what pretence ſoeuer<note n="l" place="margin">Phil. 1, 18. Mat. 23, 2, 3.</note> it be preached, if the Miniſter teach Chriſt cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, howſoeuer hee bee affected, it may haue his effect in the heart, and worke faith in the hearer: ſo is it in the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments, they haue their efficacy and operation howſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer the heart of the Miniſter be diſpoſed. And as <hi>Iſaac</hi> intended not to bleſſe <hi>Iacob</hi> but <hi>Eſau,</hi>
                  <note n="m" place="margin">Gen. 27, 1, 4, 33.</note> yet it hindered not the purpoſe and determination of God: ſo the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt intent, the wandering imagination, and rouing con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceite of the Miniſter, cannot hinder the bleſsing of God in the Sacraments, being his owne ordinances. For the force of the Sacrament dependeth no more vpon the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention of the giuer, then it doth vpon the intention of the receiuer. Againe, if the right receiuing of the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament depend vpon the intent of the Miniſter, what aſſurance can any man haue, that he hath euer receiued or ſhall euer receiue a Sacrament? What perſwaſion can we haue in our hearts that wee were euer baptized? What knowledge that we were euer partakers of the body and blood of Chriſt in the Supper of the Lord? Doth not this leaue vs vncertaine and vnſetled, without comfort, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:21092:44"/> fruite, without benefit by comming to the Sacraments, and ſetteth the poore diſtreſſed conſciences of men vpon the rack? Alas, wee cannot know the heart<note n="n" place="margin">1 Cor. 2, 11.</note> and vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand the intents thereof, <hi>For what man knoweth the things of a man, ſaue the ſpirite of man which is within him?</hi> Further<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more, were not this hard dealing and extreame cruelty in God, to hang the ſaluation of men vpon the pleaſure of the Miniſter, wherby our faith and ſaluation ſhall alwaies be doubtful? and ſhould it not be vniuſt in God, to make the euill of the Miniſter to hurt the receiuer? Beſides, ſhal it reſt in the power of the Prieſt, (if this be a power) whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the people of God are<note n="*" place="margin">Mat. 18.</note> gathered together in the name of Chriſt, and long earneſtly to bee ſatisfied with his grace, to ſend them away empty, and ſo to fruſtrate their aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly, becauſe his heart is ſtraying, and his wits a wool-ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thering? And if his intention be a matter of ſo great im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance, what priuiledge hath the receiuer that cometh with faith, aboue him that commeth without feeling? Or what ſhall become of their owne doctrine,<note place="margin">Ex opere opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to. Ex opere ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantis.</note> that the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament profiteth and is auaileable, being barely done &amp; performed, if it depend vpon the working and operation of the Sacrificer? To draw to an end of this queſtion,<note n="o" place="margin">Bellar. lib. <hi>1.</hi> de ſacra. c. <hi>28.</hi>
                  </note> our aduerſaries themſelues confeſſe, that the Church cannot iudge of things that are inward: whereupon wee frame this reaſon; If the Church cannot iudge of things inward, then it cannot iudge of the intent of the Miniſter: but they confeſſe it cannot iudge of inward things, therefore not of the intent of the Miniſter, &amp; conſequently althogh they be preſent at the action, they remaine doubtfull of conſecration. Wherefore, <hi>Bellarmine</hi> foreſeeing the inconuenience and abſurdity of this vnreaſonable &amp; vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comfortable aſſertion, confeſſeth that if one of their Maſſe-Prieſts in his miniſtration,<note n="p" place="margin">Bellar. lib. <hi>1.</hi> de ſacra. ca. <hi>27.</hi>
                  </note> intend to doe as the Church of <hi>Geneua</hi> doth, it ſufficeth to make a Sacrament effectuall and of force, This is the confeſsion of a knowne and ſworne enemy: Wherby we ſee, that howſoeuer they ſay we haue no Miniſters, no ordination, no conſecratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:21092:44"/> no Church, that our Sacraments are no better then the feaſts of <hi>Ceres</hi> and <hi>Bacchus,</hi> and lay many falſe accuſations to our charge, that the Supper of the Lord with vs is no Sacrament, but a bare ſigne without grace, without effect, without vertue: yet they are conſtrained to confeſſe and yeeld thus farre, that if a Maſſe-munger purpoſe to do as the reformed Churches do, his doing is effectuall, and the Sacrament is good. The effect of this point is this, that if we deſire to be comforted &amp; aſſured of Gods fauour whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> we come to his Supper, we muſt not hang the profit of his ordinances vpon the weak &amp; vnſtable foundation of Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſh intentions. And if there were no other point in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trouerſie betweene the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> and vs then this which now we haue in hand, it were ſufficient to make vs abhorre and abiure the Popiſh religion: in which they that liue, cannot aſſure the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues whether euer they were baptized, or receiued the Lords Supper, or were married, or abſolued of their ſinnes, whether they haue any Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, any Prieſts, or any Popes; foraſmuch as all theſe hang vpon the ſlender thred of the Prieſts intention. The Apoſtle ſaith, Rom. 14.23. <hi>Whatſoeuer is not of faith, is ſinne.</hi> But they cannot directly proue or know, whether the Prieſt going about his buſineſſe, intended to baptize the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, or to deliuer the Euchariſt vnto them, or to marry them, becauſe they know not his heart: and therefore in their adoration and worſhipping of the Sacrament, they may be Idolators, and cannot ſecure themſelues from feare of committing Idolatry. For if the ſubſtance of bread &amp; wine remaine in their nature, it followeth by neceſſarie conſequence, that they fal downe to a piece of bread, and commit greeuous Idolatry in the groſſeſt kinde, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of the Gentiles would be aſhamed. The like might bee ſaide of their Sacrament of Orders. It is not to be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued or knowne, that hee which ordered the Pope had an intention to giue him Orders. They ſay it is an high point of faith, to beleeue that the Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> is the ſucceſſor of <hi>Peter,</hi> the Vicar of Chriſt, and the head of the
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:21092:45"/> Church: yet if the Prieſt that baptized the Pope had no intention to baptize him, then is he no member of the Church, much leſſe the head of it: and if he that ordained him had no intention to ordaine him, then is he no Prieſt, much leſſe the high Prieſt: and therefore they muſt reſt al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together doubtfull and vncertaine, whether <hi>Clement</hi> or <hi>Paul,</hi> or any other ſitting in the Popes Chaire and ſea of <hi>Rome</hi> be true Pope; and thereupon cannot aſſure them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, whether the Decretals which paſſe vnder the name of Popes, were indeed their Decretals whoſe names they carry.<note place="margin">Popiſh ſhifts to iuſtifie the Prieſts inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> True it is, notwithſtanding the groſſeneſſe of this aſſertion, they haue inuented ſundry ſhifts to couer their owne ſhame and nakedneſſe: but they are as figge-leaues which are eaſily pulled away. Among the reſt two are moſt principall, which do not ſuffice to heale the wound, but ſerue rather to make it wider. Firſt of all, when they are vrged and preſſed, that the Prieſts purpoſe and intention maketh the people alwaies in doubt, and leaueth them in a maze and mammering what they doe; ſo that they oftentimes adore an vnconſecrated Hoſt, and call that God which is no God, but a bare bit of bread: Pope <hi>Adrian</hi> wil haue the Hoſt adored with condition, &amp; with a ſecret reſeruation to himſelfe, <hi>I adore thee if thou be Christ.</hi> And therefore <hi>Thomas</hi> of <hi>Saliſbury</hi> forbiddeth a man preciſely to beleeue that it is the body of the Lord. Thus though they fall downe with great deuotion at the eleuation of their God amight, yet all their adoration is made at hap-hazard, ſo that we may ſay to them as Chriſt doth of the Samaritans, Ioh. 4. <hi>Ye worſhip that which ye know not.</hi> For ſeeing their worſhip, to make it warrantable, muſt be ioyned with an [if] <hi>If it be Chriſt,</hi> it maketh them alwayes in doubt; and where doubting is, there is no faith; and where no faith is, there is ſinne, as wee noted before, according to the doctrine of the Apoſtle <hi>Iames; Aske in faith, and wauer not.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The ſecond ſhift is ſet abroach by <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> (which we touched before) that it ſufficeth, if he intend to make
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:21092:45"/> no more then that which the Church maketh: &amp; to draw out the Spiders web as long and large as he can, he ſaith, It is not needefull for the Prieſt to doe that which the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> doth, but it ſhall ſuffice, if his intention be to do that which the Church of <hi>Geneua</hi> doth. But this is a poore beggerly ſhift, that cannot helpe him: both be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he will haue it to ſuffice to worke this ſtrange feate of tranſubſtantiation, to do that which is done out of the Church, by ſchiſmaticks, by hereticks, and by Infidels: For ſuch hee accounteth thoſe that are of the Church of <hi>Geneua;</hi> he acknowledgeth them to bee no Church, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they are not ſubiect to the Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> neyther ſubmit themſelues to his authority and iurisdiction. And againe, becauſe the Church of <hi>Geneua</hi> hath an intendment not to make the body of Chriſt in their conſecration, ſo that their intention is not to intend it. Thus we ſee what ſilly ſtuffe they bring. But as they that are in danger of drowning, are ready to catch hold of euery ruſh or reede to ſee if they can ſaue themſelues: ſo do theſe Ieſuites, or elſe they would neuer teach ſo ſtrangely touching the Prieſts intention, that it ſufficeth to make the bodye of Chriſt, to haue an intent not to make it. O miſerable people led by ſuch blinde guides! O wretched guides of ſuch blinde people! what a wofull condition is this, that a man ſhall liue all the daies of his life in the boſome of their holy mother the Church, and yet her Sonnes and daughters can neuer aſſure themſelues to haue beene baptized, (though they make the want of it a note of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation) or euer to haue receiued the Lords Supper, or to haue beene married, which alſo they make a Sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, ſeeing all dependeth vpon the Prieſts intention and law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full ordination? This is the lamentable condition of all thoſe that liue vnder the hard yoke and heauy bondage of ſuperſtition. There is no peace nor comfort in ſuch a doubfull and dolefull religion. Wherefore as the Holy-Ghoſt ſaith, Reuel. 18, 4. <hi>Goe out of her my people, that yee be not partakers of her ſinnes, and that yee receiue not of her

               <p>Behold the creatures which God vſeth, as inſtruments of his mercy toward vs, the Sunne, the Moone, the Stars, fire, water, hearbes, and ſuch like: wee ought not to put any confidence in them, nor admire them as firſt and chiefe cauſes of any benefits. So our truſt ought not to be in the outward ſigns though ordained of God as holy helps vnto vs (which were to conuey his glorye to them) but our faith muſt bee lifted vp to God beeing the author of the Sacraments, and the creator of all things. The inward partes of a Sacrament are ſuch inuiſible and heauenly things as are ſignified vnder the earthly &amp; outward parts. Wee heard before, the outward parts of a Sacrament to be theſe, the Miniſter, the word, the ſigne, and the recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer:

               <p>The firſt inward part is God the<note n="f" place="margin">The firſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward part of a Sacrament is God the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</note> Father, offering and applying Chriſt and his ſauing graces to the faithful.

He doth not dally and deale falſly with vs, but truely offereth in the Sacraments Chriſt with all his guifts and benefits, if we haue hands to receiue him, he is giuen to vs.</p>
               <p>The vſe of this doctrine is, firſt of al to diſtinguiſh be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Vſe </seg>1</label>
                  <pb n="62" facs="tcp:21092:47"/> God and the Miniſter: the outward ſignes are gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen by the hands of the Miniſter, whether he be good or euill, but the truth and ſubſtance of the Sacraments is gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen by God the Father. Whoſoeuer confoundeth theſe parts and workes, robbeth God of his glory, depriueth himſelfe of the grace of Chriſt offered, and maketh fleſh his arme. Wherefore, as the workes of God and of the Miniſter are diſtinct, ſo muſt theſe parts remaine diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed, howſoeuer to the faithfull they are not ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and ſundred, as in the publiſhing and preaching of the Goſpel, the Miniſter ſpeaketh vnto the outward man, and the ſound therof entreth into the eare,<note n="g" place="margin">Act. 16, 14.</note> but it is God that openeth the heart, and ſpeaketh to the conſcience of the faithfull hearer.</p>
               <p>Secondly, it ſerueth to ſtrengthen our faith and helpe <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Vſe </seg>2</label> our weakeneſſe when we come to the Sacrament. So often as we ſee the Miniſters of God appointed by him, deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the ſignes and ſetting them apart to their ends for which they were ordained: we muſt behold with the eie of faith, God the Father offering his Sonne to thoſe that can receiue him. For if we come aright, we may aſſure our owne hearts, that what the Miniſter doth outward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, the ſame the Father performeth inwardly, then which there cannot be a greater comfort. Let vs therefore be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold with our eyes, the Sacramentall rites: let vs heare the promiſes that God maketh vnto vs: God the Father will verifie them, who hath<note n="h" place="margin">Iohn 6, 32.</note> ſealed vp his Sonne vnto vs. <hi>My Father giueth you that bread from Heauen.</hi> Hee will as ſurely giue Chriſt, as the Miniſter deliuereth the bread &amp; wine. Albeit the Sacraments ſhould be miniſtred by ſome hypocrite and wicked man: yet they haue as much force and as great efficacy, as if they were miniſtred by faithful and godly men. The vertue of the Sacraments hangeth vpon the Miniſter no more, then the goodneſſe of ſeede dependeth vpon the ſower: which if it light in good ground, wil bring forth plentifull fruit, albeit it be ſowne of an vngodly and vnskilfull man.</p>
               <pb n="63" facs="tcp:21092:47"/>
               <p>Thirdly, conſider heere the difference betweene a Sacrament and a Sacrifice. For wee learne from <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Vſe </seg>3</label> hence, that God the Father in the Sacraments doth giue his owne Sonne to the true receiuers. True it is, a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament and a Sacrifice haue ſome affinity and agreement the one with the other. They haue this in common, that both were inſtituted of God, and haue him for the author of them. In both of them there are outward actions which haue inward ſignifications: for the killing of beaſts ſhewed plainely what our condition is, both that we are guilty of death, and could not be deliuered but by an of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering for ſinne, and that Chriſt Ieſus is the true oblation to be offered to God vpon the Altar of the Croſſe for our ſinnes. Neuertheleſſe, they differ alſo in diuers reſpects; as firſt in the end. The end of a Sacrament is not to offer it vp to God, but that it bee offered to vs and receiued of vs. The Miniſter offereth the ſigne, God the Father of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fereth the thing ſignified: wee receiue the outward ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment at the hand of the Miniſter, wee receiue the inward grace at the hand of God. But the nature of a Sacrifice, is, that we giue it, or offer it vp to God, according to his owne ordinance, whereupon alſo it is called an offering or oblation. True it is alſo, that ſome of the Sacraments of the old Teſtament vnder the law were after a ſorte ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall Sacrifices, as the Paſchall Lambe: howbeit it is not ſo in the Sacraments of the Church of Chriſt, becauſe the perfect Sacrifice of Chriſt once onely offered hath a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boliſhed and abrogated all outward Sacrifices. Againe, they differ the one from the other in the outward forme and manner of doing.<note place="margin">Leuit. 16, 5.</note> For the Sacrifices were burned in part or in whole with fire, to note out the purity of Chriſts Sacrifice, and <hi>the eternall Spirite,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Heb. 9, 14.</note> by which he was offered to God: whereas they were properly called by name of Sacraments, which were eaten or applyed to the bodye; and therefore altar was appointed for the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices, but a Table for the Sacraments that were eaten.</p>

                  <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Vſe </seg>1</label> Now let vs proceed to the vſes of this point, being the ſecond inward part.

                  <hi>ye were ſealed with the holy Spirit of promiſe?</hi> Then as often as we heare the promiſe vttered by the Miniſter, it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmeth vs that the Father by his Spirit worketh the ſame in our hearts. The water in baptiſme, cannot by any force and vertue inherent in it, waſh our conſciences from dead workes to ſerue the liuing God, as it hath power to waſh away the filth and corruption of our bodies. The
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:21092:48"/> bread and wine in the Lords Supper haue no inherent ſtrength to nouriſh the ſoule to eternal life, as they haue to ſtrengthen the body: they are inſtruments of the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghoſt, who worketh by them to the great comfort of the faithfull. Grace is not contained and ſhut vp in them, as water in a veſſell, or as a medicine in a boxe: the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite helpeth our infirmities, ſealing vp to our conſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces the fruite of the word that is heard, and of the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentall ſignes that are ſeene.</p>
               <p>But becauſe this doctrine is contradicted by the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenders of the Popiſh faith, it ſhall not be amiſſe briefly to propound their chiefeſt obiections whereby they would proue that the outward ſignes in the Sacraments haue force and power to ſaue and iuſtify ſinners (howſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer the perſons be diſpoſed that partake them) &amp; then to frame ſhort anſweres to euery one of them. For what needed this inward part of the Sacraments, to wit, the working of the holy Ghoſt, if the outward waſhing were effectuall to ſaue and to ſanctifie the ſoules of all them that are baptized?<note place="margin">Grace is not tied to the Sacraments.</note> And if theſe graces were ſo tyed to the Sacraments that al which vſe them ſhould be iuſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by them, we make the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> more effectuall then the word of God it ſelfe is; foraſmuch as all that heare the worde are not ſaued by it, nor transformed into the obedience of it, nor receiue life from it, nor are regenerated by it. <hi>Iohn</hi> the <hi>Baptiſt,</hi> who was the firſt Miniſter of that Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, confeſſeth that hee could doe no more then waſh the body, it lay not in his power to giue grace and to baptize with the Holy Ghoſt.

                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Obiection. </seg>1</label> The firſt type is drawne from the hiſtory of the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, Gen. 1. <hi>The Spirite moued vpon the waters</hi> to make them fruitefull.

For as the Spirit gaue force to the waters wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the creatures were foſtered and formed, which were not of themſelues auailable to giue life, being as it were dead, and without any vigor: euen ſo the Spirit maketh the water in baptiſme ſerue to ſignifie and ſeale vp our regeneration, and not the bare and outward element. The bodye of man without the ſoule is dead and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out life: ſo the water without the Spirite cannot con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre grace. It is the Spirite that quickneth, without it the water is as common water.</p>

                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Obiection. </seg>2</label> Another obiection is from the hiſtory of the flood, Geneſis 7, 17. and the drowning of the <hi>Egyptians</hi> in the redde ſea, Exodus 14. and the paſsing of the <hi>Iſraelites</hi>
                  <pb n="67" facs="tcp:21092:49"/> through the Riuer <hi>Iordan</hi> to the land of promiſe, Ioſhua 4. where it appeareth, that the waters themſelues ſaued his people. I anſwere, <label type="milestone">

                  </label> If the waters in the flood had a proper power to ſaue and preſerue, why did they not ſaue all the world aliue? Why were any of the creatures at all drowned? Againe, this robbeth God of his ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and glory, to whom onely it is due, and giueth it to the element to which it is not due. For if <hi>Noah</hi> had beleeued that the waters could of themſelues haue ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued him, he ſhould haue ſet vp an altar as a monument to the waters, and not builded one to God the Lorde, Geneſis eight, verſe 20. But the Scripture aſcribeth all to the mercy and clemency of God toward that rem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant and remainder of mankinde, becauſe <hi>hee had ſeene Noah righteous and religious in that generation before him,</hi> Geneſis 7, verſe 1. Therefore it is ſaid hee <hi>found grace in the ſight of the Lord,</hi> Geneſis 6, verſe 18. <hi>That the Lorde ſtabliſhed his couenant with him,</hi> Geneſis 6, verſe 18. <hi>That the Lorde had him enter with all his houſhold into the Arke,</hi> Geneſis 7. verſe 1. <hi>That the Lorde ſhut him in the Arke</hi> when he was entred, Geneſis 7, verſe 16. <hi>That the Lord remembred him</hi> while he was in the <hi>Arke,</hi> Geneſis 8. verſe 1. And after the ceaſing and decreaſing of the waters, <hi>brought him out of the Arke,</hi> Geneſis 8, verſe 16. So that whereas the waters had of their owne nature ouerwhel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med them, euen the proud waters had gone ouer their ſoule to haue drowned them, God in mercy ſaued them, that they might aſcribe the praiſe of their preſeruation to the Lord of Hoaſts, not to the power of the waters And if the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> had beene deliuered at the red ſea, and in paſsing ouer <hi>Iordan</hi> by the ſtrength of the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, they would haue erected a trophee to them, &amp; not haue ſung a ſong vnto God.</p>

Beſides, if the outward cutting off the foreskinne of the fleſh were alwaies effectual to cut away the corruption of the ſoul, how is it that they teach that the Sacraments and Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices of the olde Teſtament were ſo farre from giuing grace,<note place="margin">Rhem. on Heb. <hi>10.</hi>

How can they reconcile themſelues, when they make this difference betweene the old &amp; new Sacraments, that the old did onely ſignifie, the new con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine and conferre grace and ſanctification? Thirdly, if the outward cutting off the fleſh, did by the worke done giue grace, and that the ſigne were not to be ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated from the thing ſignified, how commeth it to paſſe that <hi>Iſmael</hi> being circumciſed as well as <hi>Iſaack,</hi> and <hi>Eſau</hi> circumciſed as well as <hi>Iacob,</hi> yet one beeing <hi>borne after the fleſh, perſecuted him that was borne after the Spirite, Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſis</hi> 21. <hi>Galathians</hi> 4.29. the other was not beloued of God, neyther had grace giuen vnto him, as the Scripture ſaith, Rom, 9, 13. <hi>Iacob haue I loued, but Eſau haue I hated?</hi> Laſtly, the outward circumciſion that is in the fleſh, may bee out of the Church and receiued of them that are no

So is it with baptiſme, it doth not bring vs iuſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication by the outward worke done, but ſometimes it may go before the ſigne, and ſometimes follow after. The like might be ſaid touching Manna giuen vnto the <hi>Iſrae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites,</hi> Exod. 16. and the water of ſeparation, Num. 19.

Then there hath been from the beginning the ſame truth of religion, the ſame faith, and the ſame meanes of faith. Wee haue had the ſame Sacraments for ſubſtance throughout all generations. There was a difference in the manner and outward diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſation according vnto the ſeuerall ages &amp; growth of the Church, according to the ſeuerall times and ſeaſons that God hath appointed: howbeit the ſubſtance and effect, the truth &amp; things ſignified are one and the ſame, as the bodye is one albeit it receiue diuers garments to couer it. The Paſſeouer and Supper of the Lord, agree in the inward ſignification, both of them repreſenting, teaching, and offering the merites of Chriſts death. Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme &amp; circumciſion are likewiſe the ſame in ſubſtance, the one cutting off, the other waſhing away the natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall contagion and corruption of ſinne by the ſhedding of the blood of the Meſsiah. The ſame Goſpell was preached to <hi>Adam</hi> by the Lord himſelfe, and afterward reuealed to <hi>Abraham</hi> and his poſterity: as alſo it was publiſhed by Chriſt and his Apoſtles: albeit in the time of the lawe more darkely and obſcurely, but in the time of grace more plainely and cleerely. The ſame ſauing and iuſtifying faith was in <hi>Abraham</hi> the Father of the faithfull, and in all other that euer were or ſhalbe ſaued:
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:21092:55"/> And therefore Iohn 1, 29.<note place="margin">Reuel. 13, 8.</note> Chriſt is called <hi>The Lambe of God which taketh away the ſinnes of the world.</hi> And in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther place, <hi>The lambe ſlaine from the foundation of the world.</hi> To this purpoſe the Apoſtle ſpeaketh, 1 Cor. 10. That <hi>the Iſraelites did eate the ſame ſpirituall meat, and dranke of the ſame ſpirituall drinke</hi> (that wee doe) <hi>for they dranke of that ſpirituall Rocke which followed them, and that Rocke was Chriſt.</hi> Likewiſe in the Epiſtle to the Hebrewes, Chap. 13. <hi>Ieſus Chriſt yeſterday and to day, and the ſame for euer.</hi> Hee was alwayes the foundation of the Church, and the Fathers were ſaued by no other meanes then we are, that is, through him onely. God hath appointed him ouer al things, to be the head of the Church, and the Sauiour of his body, Epheſ. 1, 22, and 4, 16. <hi>There is giuen no other name vnder heauen, whereby we muſt bee ſaued, Acts</hi> 4, 12. <hi>No man knoweth the Father, but the Sonne, and he to whome the Sonne will reueale him, Math.</hi> 11, 27.<note place="margin">Ioh. 14, 16.</note>

No man therefore commeth vnto the Father but by him. He ſheweth, Iohn 8.56. that <hi>Abraham re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyced to ſee his day, and he ſaw it, and was glad.</hi> They which liued vnder the law and before the law as well as ſuch as liue vnder the Goſpell, were no otherwiſe iuſtified, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled, and ſaued, then by the blood of the onely me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diator Chriſt Ieſus, who indeed was the end of the law: foraſmuch as the Goſpell is no other then the law pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed, Rom. 1, 2. 1 Pet. 1 10. and the lawe is no other then the Goſpell exhibited and accompliſhed, and all the Prophets beare witneſſe of Chriſt and his Goſpell, Acts 10. For albeit he was manifeſted in the fleſh in the laſt age of the world, and was crucified when the fulnes of time came: yet his death was as effectual to the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full before the flood and after the flood, before the law
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:21092:56"/> and after the giuing of the law, as to the faithfull that li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued with Chriſt, and after the aſcenſion of Chriſt: and it was as powerfull and profitable to them that liued be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he dwelt vpon the earth, as when hee did hang vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon the Croſſe. This point duely marked, offereth vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to vs diuers good meditations to bee pondered in our hearts. Firſt, that there is but one faith, and one true religion, one way to heauen, and one truth in all the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments, albeit they haue diuers formes and figures.

Secondly, the Fathers before Chriſts incarnation and taking fleſh of the bleſſed Virgin were ſaued, and went in ſoule to heauen as directly and cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainely as they doe that dye now in the faith of Chriſt.

                  <hi>becauſe it was not mingled with faith in thoſe that heard it.</hi> If the ſignes be receiued without faith, they hurt: not that Gods guifts and ordinances hurt of themſelues, but not being recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued aright, they hurt through our ſinne and default. As the word not receiued by faith is an empty ſound with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out force: ſo the Sacrament is an vnprofitable and a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked ſhew without ſubſtance. Wherefore the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments in regard of the vnbeleeuers and vngodly, are no Sacraments to them, becauſe to them they are not ſeales of the righteouſneſſe of faith. True it is, they remaine Sacraments, in reſpect of God who offereth his owne Sonne, but they looſe their ſtrength and force toward the vnfaithfull, that do abuſe and contemne them;<note n="h" place="margin">Rom. 2, 25.</note> as the Apoſtle expreſly teacheth, <hi>Circumciſion verily is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable if thou keepe the law: but if thou bee a tranſgreſſor of the law, thy circumciſion is become vncircumciſion.</hi> The ſame Apoſtle ſpeaking of ſuch<note n="i" place="margin">1 Cor. 11, 20.</note> as vſed the Lords ſupper with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out true godlines and due preparation, ſaith, <hi>This is not to eate the Lords Supper;</hi> denying that to be, which was not

Let vs ſeeke to preuent his iudgements before they come, which wee may do, by

This then is the remedy to auoide the ſinne of vnworthy receiuing. A man thus viſited with ſickneſſe, weakneſſe, and diuers kinds of diſeaſes, and ſmitten with the ſtroke of Gods owne hand, cannot poſsibly be reſtored by any creature in heauen or earth: and yet behold the Lord hath not left vs without meanes to remooue them and take them away, to wit, by taking away the cauſe, that wee may remoue the effects. The cauſe of theſe puninſhments is taken away by iudging our ſelues.

No denying of the fact, no defending of the fault, no hiding of the offence, no iuſtifying of our perſon can procure our pardon: the way to haue forgiueneſſe, is to acknowledge our owne wickedneſſe. Thirdly, he muſt condemne himſelfe, and giue ſentence againſt himſelf without partiality.

Euery thing muſt be referred to his right vſes and proper ends: ſo muſt the Sacraments be.</p>
               <pb n="90" facs="tcp:21092:61"/>
               <p>The ends are eſpecially<note n="a" place="margin">Three chief vſes of the ſa<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>craments.</note> theſe three. Firſt, to ſtreng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then faith. Secondly, to ſeale the couenant betweene God and vs. Thirdly, to be a badge of our profeſsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Touching the firſt ende, the Sacraments ſerue for the better confirmation of our faith, as appeareth, 1. Pet. 3. where the Apoſtle hauing ſet downe the drowning of the world, and the preſeruing of <hi>Noah</hi> by the <hi>Arke,</hi> he ſaith our baptiſme<note n="b" place="margin">1 Pet. 3, 21.</note> directly anſwereth that type, which is a taking to witneſſe of a good conſcience, and ſauing vs by the reſurrection of Chriſt. So then, by faith con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed in Baptiſme, we haue an infallible aſſurance in the death of Chriſt of our ſaluation. Many indeede come to the Sacraments, are preſent at baptiſme, are partakers of the Lords Supper, that feele no ſtrength of faith, no increaſe of Gods graces, no ſpirituall growth in the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of Chriſt, ſo that they worke not ſaluation in them, but further their condemnation. For the Sacraments (as we haue ſhewed) giue not grace, but more firmely, ſurely, and comfortably confirme faith, they apply and ſeale vp Chriſt crucified. The Sacraments cannot giue faith to the faithleſſe, neyther were they inſtituted to the end men ſhould beleeue, but becauſe they doe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue: as meat was not giuen that men ſhould learne to eate, but that they eating might be nouriſhed. Faith indeed receiueth them,<note n="c" place="margin">Auguſt. de ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uit. dei. lib. <hi>25.</hi> cap. <hi>25.</hi>
                  </note> and then they ſerue to nouriſh it. And they confirme not faith by any inherent power included in them, but the holye Spirite applyeth Chriſt to vs, and frameth this comfortable concluſion in our hearts. All ſuch as are conuerted and doe rightly vſe the Sacraments, ſhall receiue Chriſt &amp; all his ſauing gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces: But I am conuerted and doe rightly vſe the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments: Therefore I ſhall receiue Chriſt and his graces. Thus doth the Comforter comfort all thoſe that come rightly and religiouſly to the Lords Table.</p>
               <p>Now if wee would enquire and ſearch after the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of this firſt end, we ſhould finde that one cauſe why they confirme faith is, becauſe God is true in his promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:21092:61"/> he confirmeth and maketh good that which is gone out of his mouth. All the<note n="d" place="margin">2 Cor. 1, 20.</note> promiſes of God in Chriſt Ieſus are yea and are in him Amen, vnto the glory of God through vs. For as Princes ſeales confirme their charters, aſſure their grants, and make certaine their pardons: ſo do Gods Sacraments witneſſe to our hearts and conſciences, that his words and promiſes are true and are eſtabliſhed to continue for euer. For as he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clareth his mercies by his word, ſo hee ſealeth and aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth them by his Sacraments. Againe, this appeareth by the example of <hi>Abraham,</hi> who firſt beleeued the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, and it was imputed to him for righteouſneſſe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing yet vncircumciſed; and afterward receiued the ſigne of circumciſion as the ſeale of the righteouſnes of faith, as the Apoſtle<note n="e" place="margin">Rom. 4, 9, 10, 11.</note> teacheth: <hi>We ſay that faith was imputed vnto Abraham for righteouſneſſe: How was it then imputed? when he was circumciſed, or vncircumciſed? Not when hee was circumciſed, but when he was vncircumciſed, &amp;c.</hi> Where he ſheweth that <hi>Abraham</hi> was iuſtified in vncircumciſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, but yet was afterward circumciſed, that the guift of righteouſnes might be confirmed in him. The<note n="f" place="margin">Acts 8, 36.</note> Eunuch likewiſe beleeued before he receiued baptiſme, &amp; ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it ſealed vp the increaſe of his faith &amp; of Gods gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. And Acts 2. <hi>They that gladly receiued the words of Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi>
                  <note n="g" place="margin">Acts 2.41. &amp; 10, 44, 47, 48. and 22, 16.</note> 
                  <hi>were baptized.</hi> And, as <hi>Peter</hi> preached to <hi>Cornelius</hi> and others of the Gentiles, <hi>The Holy Ghoſt fell on them all which heard the word,</hi> and he ſaid, <hi>Can any forbid water that theſe ſhould not be baptized, which haue receiued the Holy Ghoſt as well as we?</hi> So he commanded them to be bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed in the name of the Lord. Wherefore, when the Miniſter waſheth with water, it repreſenteth our burial with Chriſt, into his death, and our riſing againe with him into newneſſe of life. As bread nouriſheth and ſtrengtheneth man: ſo the body of Chriſt taken by faith feedeth the ſoule. We take the bread and cup into our hands, we eate, we drinke, we are refreſhed: ſo we feed on Chriſt, whoſe fleſh is meate indeed, &amp; whoſe blood
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:21092:62"/> is drinke indeed, and we are comforted.</p>

For wee feele not corruption by corruption, nor ſinne by ſinne,<note n="l" place="margin">Lu. 11, 21, 22</note> becauſe when the ſtrong man poſſeſſeth the houſe, all things are in peace: but we feele ſinne and perceiue cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption in vs by a contrary grace of Gods Spirit. The leſſer and ſmaller meaſure of grace we haue, the leſſer is our feeling: &amp; the more grace we haue, the more quicke we are in feeling of corruption. What is the reaſon that many haue no ſight of ſinne, no feeling of their cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption, no tentations, no trembling, no terror, no feare of Gods wrath, but wholy liue, lye, and dye in their luſtes? Surely, becauſe they are without grace, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Gods Spirite, &amp; without his inward worke in them. But the faithfull who are not led by the fleſh but by the

For faith though aſſaulted with doubtings may be certaine. The Sunne alwaies ſhineth in the fir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mament, though the clouds haue couered it, and the light appeare not. The tree hath life in it, though it be not in winter diſcerned. So faith hath his aſſurance &amp; perſwaſion, though it be ſhaken with doubtings, and aſſaulted with tentations. Wherfore, ſo often as we feele theſe doubtings &amp; imperfections, let vs ſet againſt them the certainty of Gods truth: let vs ſet before vs the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changeablenes of his promiſes: let vs draw neer to the holy Sacram. &amp; therby ſeek ſtrength &amp; increaſe of faith.</p>

This we muſt certainely be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue by faith. And this made the Apoſtle<note n="t" place="margin">Rom. 8, 38.39.</note> moſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident in the end of the ſame Chapter, ſaying, <hi>I am per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded that neyther death, nor life, nor Angels, nor principa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities, nor powers, nor things preſent, nor things to come, nor height, nor depth, nor any other creature, ſhall be able to ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate vs from the loue of God which is in Chriſt Ieſus our Lord.</hi> If any obiect, we may hope well for forgiuenes of ſins, but we cannot beleeue the ſame. I anſwere, Faith and hope cannot be ſeparated, they doe alwayes as louing friends accompany each other, they are neuer ſundered and diuided; ſo that if we may be aſſured of our ſaluati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on by hope, it followeth we may be certainely perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded. True hope followeth true faith, as the effect doth the cauſe, and no man can truely hope, that is not truely aſſured.

                  <hi>all-ſufficient, walke before me, and be vpright.</hi> The Sacraments are aſſured teſtimonies and confirmations of the fauour and good will of God, who is well pleaſed toward vs in Chriſt his Sonne. By them as by certaine pledges giuen and receiued, God of his great mercy doth as it were binde himſelfe to vs, &amp; wee binde our ſelues to him to remaine his people, and to walke in obedience before him: for they bee as ſtrong chaines to compaſſe vs, as ſure cords to hold vs, and as faſt knots to keepe vs, that we do not depart from him, and caſt off the feare of his name. Circumciſion was a ſeale of Gods promiſe to <hi>Abraham,</hi> and a ſeale of <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hams</hi> faith and obedience toward God. But let vs ſee what<note n="c" place="margin">What the couenant is betweene God &amp; man.</note> this couenant is, what are the Articles of agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment betweene God and vs, and what things each part interchangeably couenanteth and contracteth each to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward other. The couenant of God in reſpect of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, hath three parts. He promiſeth,<note n="d" place="margin">Rom 11, 26 Ier. 33, 8. Eſay 43, 25.</note> firſt of all, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giueneſſe of our ſinnes: for <hi>The deliuerer ſhall come out of Sion, and ſhall turne away the vngodlineſſe from Iacob, and this is my couenant to them, when I ſhall take away their ſinnes.</hi> Secondly, the adoption<note n="e" place="margin">Ier. 31, 31.32, 33. 2 Cor. 6, 16.18. Zach. 8, 8.</note> of ſonnes and acceptation of vs to be his children, ioyned with the promiſe of his co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuall fauour, loue, grace, and protection: as Iere. 31. <hi>Behold, the dayes come (ſaith the Lord,) that I will make a new couenant with the houſe of Iſrael and with the houſe of Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dah, not according to the couenant that I made with their fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, when I tooke them by the hand to bring them out of the
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:21092:64"/> Land of Egypt, the which my couenant they brake, although I was an husband vnto them, ſaith the Lord: but this ſhall be the couenant that I will make with the houſe of Iſrael, after thoſe daies ſaith the Lord, I will put my Law in their inward parts, and write it in their hearts, and I will be their God, and they ſhall be my people.</hi> Behold, the indenture of coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants written by the finger of God, wherein for better aſſurance he hath bound himſelfe to forgiue our ſins, &amp; promiſed to be our mercifull God. And to the end there might be a paire of theſe indentures, interchangeably giuen each to other party; the Lord by the hand of the Apoſtle, writing to the <hi>Hebrewes,</hi> hath drawn as it were the counterpane of the former word for word, expreſſed as it is in the Prophet;<note n="f" place="margin">Heb. 8, 10, 11</note> ſo that we haue a paire of inden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures of couenants, to ſhew the ſtablenes of his counſell. The 3. part of the couenant in reſpect of God is,<note n="g" place="margin">Reuel. 21, 4.7.</note> the promiſe of the full poſſeſsio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the heauenly inheritance and of eternall glory after this life, as Reuel. 21. <hi>God ſhall wipe away all teares from their eyes, and there ſhall be no more death, neither ſorrow, neither crying, neither ſhall there be any more paine, for the firſt things are paſſed: he that ouercometh ſhal inherit all things:</hi> Alſo cha. 2. <hi>To him that ouercommeth, will I giue to eate of the tree of life which is in the midſt of the Paradice of God, he ſhall not be hurt of the ſecond death: he ſhal haue power giuen him ouer the Nations, and rule them with a rod of iron: he ſhal be cloathed with white array, and I wil not put his name out of the booke of life: hee ſhall be a pillar in the Temple of God, &amp; ſhal go no more out. I will grant to him to fit with me in my throne, euen as I ouercame, &amp; fit with my Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in his throne.</hi> Thus we ſee, how God on his part, by writings and euidences promiſeth to giue to his people remiſsion of ſins, adoption of ſons, &amp; poſſeſsion of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen; he hath couenanted by word &amp; by oth to performe theſe things: neither is he as man that he ſhould lie, nor as the ſon of man that he ſhold deceiue. Theſe are great grants, of great bleſsings, by our great God, to the great good &amp; co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fort of his childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. For what greater bleſsings
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:21092:65"/> can there be, then being miſerable ſinners, to be graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly pardoned? being vtter enemies; to bee freely ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted as ſonnes? beeing bondſlaues and priſoners of hell, to be made heires of heauen and ſaluation? Againe, the couenant on our part requireth three conditions: for when men intend to couenant and contract one with a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother, they ſet downe articles, as well on the one ſide as on the other. Firſt, faith to God, to beleeue his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes, as Iohn 3.16. <hi>God ſo loued the world, that hee hath giuen his onely begotten Sonne, that whoſoeuer beleeueth in him ſhould not periſh, but haue euerlasting life.</hi> And Cha. 14. <hi>Let not your heart be troubled, ye beleeue in God, beleeue alſo in me.</hi> And Rom. 10. <hi>With the heart man beleeueth vnto righteouſneſſe, and with the mouth man confeſſeth vnto ſalua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: for the Scripture ſaith, whoſoeuer beleeueth in him ſhall not be aſhamed.</hi> Secondly, God requireth of vs loue to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward our brethren: for ſeeing he hath ſhewed ſo great loue toward vs,<note n="k" place="margin">1 Iohn 4, 7, 9, 10, 11.</note> he exacteth loue of vs againe, as <hi>Iohn</hi> exhorteth, <hi>Beloued, let vs loue one another, for loue commeth of God, and euery one that loueth is borne of God, and knoweth God: heerein was the loue of God made manifeſt among vs, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe God ſent his onely begotten Son into this world, that wee might liue through him: beloued, if God ſo loued vs, wee ought alſo to loue one another.</hi> Thirdly, he requireth as a neceſſary couenant to be kept on our part, holines, &amp; true obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence throughout the whole courſe<note n="l" place="margin">Ioſh. 24, 24.25. 2 Kings 29, 3.</note> of our life and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſation. This is repeated and vrged in many places of the word of God, as Ioſh. 24. when they ſaid they would ſerue the Lord their God &amp; obey his voice, <hi>Ioſhua</hi> made a couenant with them the ſame day, ioyning God &amp; the people together. So alſo <hi>Ioſiah</hi> ſtood by the pillar and made a couenant before the Lord, <hi>that they ſhould walke after the Lord, and keepe his commandements, and his teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, and his ſtatutes, with al their hart and with al their ſoul.</hi> Likewiſe, to the ſame purpoſe we reade, 2. Chro. 15. <hi>They made a couenant to ſeeke the Lord God of their Fathers: and whoſoeuer will not ſeeke the Lord God of Iſrael, ſhall be ſlaine,
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:21092:65"/> whether he be ſmall or great, man or woman.</hi> Thus we ſee the conditions of the couenant, both what he promiſeth to doe, and what he looketh for at our hands. He requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth of vs faith, loue, and obedience to become his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, if we will haue him to be our God. All theſe three parts of the couenant,<note n="m" place="margin">1 Iohn 3, 23 24.</note> are mentioned and expreſſed, 1. Iohn 3. <hi>This is his commandement, that wee beleeue in the name of his Sonne Ieſus Chriſt, and loue one another as he gaue commandement: for he that keepeth his commandements, dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth in him, and he in him: and heereby we know that hee abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth in vs, euen by the Spirite that he hath giuen vs.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The vſes of the ſecond end of a Sacrament are, firſt to <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Vſe </seg>1</label> behold the exceeding loue of God toward his people vnworthy of his fauour. Can there be a greater loue then this? Certainly ſuch as know the great rigor of the law, the infinite iuſtice of God, and the heauy burthen of ſin: and feele God to arraigne them, the law to endite them, their conſciences to accuſe them, and their hearts to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne them, do finde nothing ſweeter then to be eaſed of that burthen, to be acquitted of that Iudge, and to be freed from that condemnation. For of all burdens ſin is the heauieſt; of all wounds it is the deepeſt; of all afflic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions it is the greateſt; of all paines it is the ſharpeſt, and often preſſeth downe to the gates of hell. Wherefore ſuch as feele Gods mercy in their miſery,<note n="n" place="margin">Pſal. 32, 1.2.</note> may cry out with the Prophet in the reioycing of their ſpirite <hi>Bleſſed is he, whoſe wickedneſſe is lightened, and whoſe ſin is couered, Bleſſed is the man, vnto whom the Lord imputeth not iniquity.</hi> This kindneſſe is ſo great, that the eternall God ſhould make a couenant with duſt and aſhes, that it ought neuer to be forgotten of vs vs, nor depart out of our hearts.</p>
               <p>Againe, let euery one be carefull to keepe the former <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Vſe </seg>2</label> conditions of the Couenant, which are, to loue him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, and our brethren for his ſake,<note n="o" place="margin">Luke 1, 74.75.</note> and to walke in holineſſe and righteouſneſſe before him all the dayes of our life. Our Sauiour Chriſt directing our loue to our brethren, and teaching that the ſtreames thereof ſhould
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:21092:66"/> flow vnto our enemies, ſheweth that if we loue the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that loue vs, the<note n="o" place="margin">Mat. 5, 44.46, 47.</note> Publicans do the ſame: &amp; if we be friendly to our brethren only, this is no ſingular thing. Behold<note n="p" place="margin">1 Iohn 3, 1.</note>, what loue the Father hath giuen vnto vs, that we ſhould be called the Sons of God: he loued vs graciouſly &amp; free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly: he loued vs whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> we were enemies vnto him, &amp; ſpared not his own Son, but gaue him to death for vs al: do not theſe things deſerue loue againe? are we not bound to ſhew duty for theſe mercies, and loue to our brethren for this loue of our God? &amp; yet many regard neyther theſe bleſsings of God, neither walking in vprightnes of hart <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Vſe </seg>3</label> before him. Thirdly, is God &amp; ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> entred into a ſolemne couenant, &amp; are the Sacraments ſeals of it? The<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt of the Sacraments is the contempt of God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe &amp; of his couenant made with vs, and therfore wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thily to be condemned, and iuſtly to bee cenſured of the Church. If men wer throughly perſwaded of this truth, I am perſwaded they wold not ſhew this careleſnes &amp; pro<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>phanenes in coming to theſe ordinances of God. They are not bare and naked promiſes, but couenants of mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy &amp; fauour. Euery couenant is a promiſe, but euery pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe is not a couenant. <hi>Abraham</hi> had receiued many pro<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>miſes from God, of reconciliation, of poſterity, of bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing &amp; protection, that he would be his buckler, his bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warke, and his great reward, and giue vnto his ſeed the land of <hi>Canaan;</hi> yet we reade not that God as yet made a couenant with him, vntill by a ſolemne rite and cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony he eſtabliſhed it, Ge. 15. where we ſee that <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> took an heiffer, a ſhee-goate, and a ramme, and diui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded them in the midſt, <hi>and laid each piece one againſt ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther In the ſame day the Lord made a couenant with him.</hi> This he confirmed afterward by the ſigne of circumciſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as alſo hee confirmeth his couenant with vs by two Sacraments. If any were asked the queſtion whether they would haue God to be their God, gracious and merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full vnto them, they would anſwere it is their whole de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire: howbeit if we would haue God magnifie his mercy toward vs, we muſt magnify &amp; make much of his ſacram.
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:21092:66"/> whereby he hath ſealed vp his loue toward vs. Could <hi>Abraham</hi> haue God to be his God, and the God of his ſeede, and yet reiect circumciſion commanded vnto him, which was a ſigne of the couenant? Could the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> acknowledge God to be the author of their deliuerance out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> and yet refuſe the Paſſeouer that was inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted in remembrance of their deliuery and of his mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy? O that we could conſider theſe things, and learne them aright, to make vs wiſe to God and to our ſelues. If wee giue to any man a piece of mony to binde a bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine that hath paſſed betweene him and vs, we would thinke ourſelues much abuſed, if hee ſhould not count himſelfe tyed by it to performe his promiſe and make good his word. So hath God left with vs his Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments (as an earneſt penny) to aſſure vs of his word, and the vnchangeable faithfulneſſe of his promiſe: ſhall we then make no account of them? or eſteeme them at our owne pleaſure? We make our ſelues guilty of the blood of Chriſt, and as much as lyeth in vs, ſay to the almighty, Depart from vs, we will none of the knowledge of thy waies, we will walke after the ſtubbornnes of our harts.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, are the Sacraments as a band with a condition? that leaueth vs not at liberty to doe what wee liſt, but <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Vſe </seg>4</label> bindeth vs to performe the condition? Then wee muſt learne from hence, that howſoeuer God haue dealt in mercy toward vs, offering vs the pardon of our ſinnes, promiſing to receiue vs as ſonnes, and aſſuring vs to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtow vpon vs eternall life: yet if we be not faithfull and obedient vnto him, but reiect theſe benefits from vs, &amp; walke not worthy of them, they ſhall be taken from vs &amp; giuen to a people that will make more account of them, The couenant that God hath made, is a mutuall promiſe and agreement betweene God and man, whereby God giueth men aſſurance that he will be gracious &amp; fauou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable vnto them, remitting their ſinnes, beſtowing vpon the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> righteouſnes, bringing the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to ſaluation &amp; reſeruing them to his heauenly kingdome through Chriſt his Son
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:21092:67"/> and our redeemer. And on the other ſide, men binde themſelues to faith, repentance, and obedience, and to be thankful vnto him for ſo great and gracious benefits. This mutuall compact and couenant, that it might bee made firme and authenticall, is ſealed by the outward badges and tokens of baptiſme and the Lords Supper, which are ſacred ſignes teſtifying Gods good will to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward vs, and confirming our duty toward him. This is no ſmall mercy ſhewed vnto vs, but the moſt ſacred and ſoueraigne guift of God that can be beſtowed vpon any people in this life: as Pſal. 111.9. The Prophet remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>breth in the laſt place, that <hi>he ſent redemption vnto his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, he hath commanded his couenant for euer.</hi> So the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle maketh it as a wonderfull priuiledge that God gaue to the Iewes, in that they had the ſigne of <hi>circumciſion and the Oracles of God committed vnto them, Rom.</hi> 3, 1, 2. According to the ſaying of the Prophet,<note place="margin">Pſal. 14.19.20.</note> 
                  <hi>Hee ſhewed his word to Iacob, his ſtatutes and ordinances vnto Iſrael: he hath not dealt ſo with euery Nation, neither haue they knowne his iudgements.</hi> This ought to teach diligence, and worke conſcience in al ſorts of men, leaſt we depriue our ſelues of the guifts of God lent vnto vs and beſtowed vpon vs. Thus we ſee firſt of all, that mankinde generally, ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther was, neither is within the couenant, but onely ſuch as by faith imbrace and lay holde on the couenant. The Apoſtle ſaith, Gal. 3.22. <hi>The Scripture hath concluded all vnder ſin, that the promiſe by the faith of Ieſus Chriſt ſhould be giuen to them that beleeue.</hi> Without faith it is vnpoſsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to pleaſe God, and therefore there is no promiſe of reconciliation made without faith. The couenant be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene God and man touching righteouſnes and eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall life, was deliuered and reuealed from the beginning to our firſt parents, immediately after their fall, before they were driuen out of the Garden of Eden, Gen. 3, 15. <hi>The ſeede of the Woman ſhall bruiſe the Serpents head.</hi> And in the tenour of this couenant God did put a difference betweene the ſeede of the woman and the ſeede of the
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:21092:67"/> Serpent. By the ſeed of the woman he meaneth, the head and his members, Chriſt and the faithfull that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue in him: as alſo by the ſeed of the Serpent, all the reprobate that liue and dye in their ſinnes, foraſmuch as <hi>he that committeth ſinne is of the Diuell,</hi> 1 Iohn 3, 8. and, <hi>he is their father.</hi> Iohn 8, 44. Hence we ſee, how foule and fearefull a thing it is to be without faith, all ſuch are without life, without Chriſt, without the couenant, euen ſtrangers from the couenants of promiſe, without hope, and without God in the world. Againe, al ſuch as contemne grace offered vnto them in the Mediator Chriſt Ieſus, who is the foundation and ground-worke of this couenant, in whom all the promiſes of God are yea, and amen: All ſuch as follow ſinne with greedines, and drinke iniquity as water, ſuch as are both bare and barren in good things for euer, but plentifull in bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing forth the workes of darkneſſe, and the fruites of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedience, are all out of the couenant, and haue no pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe made vnto them of grace, of righteouſneſſe, of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciliation, of protection, and of ſaluation: It is requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red of vs to <hi>repent and beleeue the Goſpell,</hi> Mar. 1, 15. But if we begin to breake with God, ſhall we thinke to hold him cloſe to his couenant, and to challenge him with his word? Will we tye him to conditions, and imagine to goe free our ſelues? Will we vrge him hard with his promiſe, and as it were lay heauy burdens vpon him, and not touch them our ſelues with our little finger? Hee promiſeth nothing vnto vs, except we keepe couenant with him. And what reaſon is it, that we ſhould looke to receiue bleſsings at his hands, when we will yeelde no duty of obedience vnto him? For as God promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth to bee with vs and beſtow all good things vpon vs, ſo we binde our ſelues vnto him, to become his children and his ſeruants, to feare him, to loue him, and to walke in vprightneſſe before him. God neuer beginneth to breake with vs, neither falſifyeth his truth. He neuer forſaketh vs vntill we forſake him: and therefore the
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:21092:68"/> Prophet ſaid to <hi>Aſa</hi> king of <hi>Iuda,</hi> 2. <hi>Chron.</hi> 15, 2. <hi>The Lord is with you, while ye he with him: and if ye ſeeke him, hee will be found of you: but if ye forſake him, hee will forſake you.</hi> In all couenants the condition muſt euer more be mark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, conſidered, and obſerued. It is vnpoſsible that God ſhould lye, he cannot faile vs or deceiue vs. The like fidelity toward him is required of vs. It is not e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough for vs to know what God hath promiſed, but it is requiſite for vs to learne vpon what conditions he hath promiſed to be gracious vnto vs. He neuer promiſed to be mercifull vnto any, but vnder the expreſſe conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of ſincere obedience. If we will beleeue and obey, we ſhall proſper: but if we become rebellious and ſtub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borne, he will alſo walke ſtubbornely againſt vs, and bring vpon vs all the curſes theatned in his word.</p>

                  </note> we are gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red into one Church, and knit together in one, as Ephe. 2. <hi>Remember that ye that ye being in times paſt Gentiles in the fleſh,<note n="c" place="margin">Ephe. 2, 11, 12, 13.</note> and called vncircumciſion of thom which are called circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion in the fleſh made with hands, ye were at that time with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Chriſt, without God, without hope: but now in Chriſt Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus ye which once were farre off, are made neare by the blood of Chriſt.</hi> The Iewes by circumciſion were diſtinguiſhed from other people,<note n="d" place="margin">1 Sam. 17, 36.</note> and the name of vncircumciſed
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:21092:68"/> was reprochfull, they were accounted vncleane and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holy perſon, for the vncircumciſed males were to bee<note n="e" place="margin">Gen. 17.14.</note> cut off from the number of the people of God. So by baptiſme we are ſeparated from all other religions, and are conſecrated only to Chriſtian religion: and ſuch as continue vnbaptiſed with contempt of that Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, we take them not for our brethren, nor for the people of God, nor for members of his Church, becauſe they refuſe to take the Sacrament of baptiſme, as the badge &amp; cognizance by which they ſhould be knowne: ſuch as are Atheiſts, Infidels, Sarazens, Turkes, Perſians, Moores, Iewes, and other nations that want this marke to be diſcerned to belong to the family of Chriſt. Chriſt Ieſus ſending out his Apoſtles, bad them teach and bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe the Gentiles,<note n="f" place="margin">Mat. 28, 19. Mar. 16, 16. Acts 2, 39, 41.42.</note> to whom he directed them: therfore where the word and Sacraments are, there is a Church and Congregation of the people of God. And Mar. 16, 16. <hi>He that beleeueth and is baptiſed ſhalbe ſaued.</hi> And heereunto commeth that ſaying, Acts 2. When the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, had exhorted the people to amend their liues, and to ſaue themſelues from that froward generation, <hi>Then they that gladly receiued the word were baptiſed: and they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued in the Apoſtles doctrine, and fellowſhip, and breaking of bread, and prayers, and the ſame day there was added to the Church three thouſand ſoules.</hi> Thus we ſee that by the Sacraments as by certaine bands and chaines, God knit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth and bindeth his people to himſelfe, and keepeth them in his couenant, leaſt they ſhould part aſunder and fall away to infidelity. And the people are warned, that by theſe outward ſignes they differ from the bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barous ſauages, and vnbeleeuing Gentiles, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently ſhould indeuour &amp; prouide that they likewiſe differ from them in thoſe things that are ſignified by thoſe ſignes.</p>

Is it not Chriſts? we are not therefore our owne men, as the Apoſtle reaſoneth and concludeth, 1 Cor. 6, 19, 20. <hi>Know ye not that your body is the temple of the Holy-Ghoſt, which is in you, whom ye haue of God? and ye are not your owne.

Wherefore to the right vſe and partaking of the Sacraments, ther is required the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of God in three perſons, eſpecially of the perſon of Chriſt, perfect God and perfect man, and of his three

Let vs ſee then how many ſuch viſible ſignes and ſeales of ſpiritual grace in the new Teſtament, were inſtituted of God to ſet forth the benefits of Chriſt, for the conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuall vſe of the Church. Many liue in the boſome of the Church, heare the word, come to publike prayer, take themſelues to be goodly Chriſtians, offer themſelues to the Lords-table, &amp; are made partakers of the Sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts, who yet are ignorant how many Sacraments there are, and what they are. None almoſt ſo ſimple but he can number his ſheepe and cattell: he knoweth their markes, he knoweth their differences: but aske him how many commandements of the law, how many Articles of faith, how many petitions of the Lords prayer, or how many
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:21092:71"/> Sacraments of the new Teſtament, hee can anſwere nothing. They know no difference betweene commandement &amp; commandment, betweene the firſt Table and the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond, betweene article and article, and betweene one petition and another. Such haue their wits wholy ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſed on the world, and on worldly things, which iuſtle out religion and the knowledge of heauenly things. If we haue eares to heare, let vs heare what is the faith of the Church in this point, grounded vpon the infallible rule and rocke of the word of God. The Sacraments of the Church ordained by Chriſt, to aſſure our commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion with him are onely two:<note n="b" place="margin">Chriſt inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted onely two Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</note> Baptiſme whereby wee are receiued into the couenant of God, in ſtead of cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion: and the Lords Supper, whereby we are nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhed, maintained, and retained therein, in ſtead of the Paſſeouer. For albeit the couenant be but one, yet the ſcales thereof are two, to aſſure vs that by vnion with Chriſt, we are regenerated and ſhall bee nouriſhed to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall life. Hee hath deliuered vs a few Sacraments in ſtead of many, he could haue inſtituted moe if hee had thought it good for the benefit of the Church. Theſe are as it were the two eyes whereby we ſee and behold the promiſes of God. Theſe are as the two hands, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by we after a ſort do handle Chriſt crucified &amp; lay holde on the graces of ſaluation. Chriſt hath appointed no moe Sacraments, he hath laide on vs an eaſie yoke and a light burden.</p>
               <p>That theſe two are the onely Sacraments of the new Teſtament, may appeare by theſe reaſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> Lord Ieſus liued on the earth,<note place="margin">Luke 1, 76. and 33.</note> he inſtituted baptiſme, by the miniſtry of <hi>Iohn Baptiſt,</hi> who as hee was ſent to prepare the hearts of the people, ſo he preached the baptiſme of repentance: Afterward the Lord Ieſus eſtabliſh it with his owne mouth, in the commiſsion giuen to his Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples:
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:21092:71"/> So he appointed and himſelfe firſt adminiſtred his laſt Supper in remembrance of his death, vntill his ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond comming againe with power &amp; great glory. Theſe two true Sacraments of the Church, to wit, baptiſme &amp; the Lords Supper were inſtituted and warranted by the mouth of Chriſt himſelfe, and none other beſide theſe. Theſe we receiue becauſe Chriſt ordained them: other we receiue not, becauſe he ordained them not.</p>
               <p>Secondly, the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> admoniſheth the <hi>Corin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thians</hi> to beware of Idolatry, not to flatter themſelues, or to thinke themſelues the members of Chriſt, &amp; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſhould eſcape the iudgement of God, becauſe they had the Sacraments: for the Church of the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> had as great priuiledges as they, they had the ſame Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments<note n="e" place="margin">1 Cor. 10.1.2, 3, 4.</note> the ſame Baptiſme, the ſame Supper in ſubſtance and effect, yet God was not pleaſed with them, but o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerthrew them in the wilderneſſe. If then the <hi>Corinthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> had any moe then theſe two, they might haue iuſtly replied, We grant indeed, in reſpect of theſe they are equall with vs, but we haue other which they had not, wherein they are inferior to vs, and we ſuperior to them, and therefore are preferred before them. If then the Apoſtles reaſon conclude ſtrongly, we may hence gather directly, that there are onely two and no other Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, becauſe the Apoſtle mentioneth no moe, where he purpoſeth to ſet forth the priuiledges of the <hi>Iewes,</hi> &amp; to make them equall with the <hi>Gentiles.</hi> Wherefore wee muſt receiue two Sacraments onely, or elſe the Apoſtle hath reaſoned weakely.</p>
               <p>Furthermore, the ſame Apoſtle 1. <hi>Corinthians</hi> 12.3. pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing to ſhew that many members of the Church are one body in Chriſt coupled by him as by ioynts, proo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth this point by a full enumeration ot the Sacraments, being pledges of our ſetting into the body of Chriſt and continuall nouriſhment in the ſame, when he ſaith, <hi>As by one Spirite we are all baptized nto one body, whether Iewes or Gentiles, ſo we haue all beene made to dri ke into one Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite,</hi>
                  <pb n="112" facs="tcp:21092:72"/> Where the Apoſtle ſheweth, that all the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full by the effectuall working of the Holy-Ghoſt are made one body in Chriſt, which hee confirmeth by the two ſacraments of Baptiſme and the Lords Supper, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out mention of any moe.</p>
               <p>Moreouer, another reaſon may be framed, by compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the Church of the Iewes with the Churches of the Chriſtians in regard of their ordinary Sacraments. There are no moe Sacraments deliuered in the Goſpell, then were prefigured vnder the lawe: for their Sacraments were types anſwering to our Sacraments, as 1 Pet. 3, 21. <hi>Our baptiſme anſwereth the figure of the waters, refreſenting the ſame that our Baptiſme doth.</hi> True it is, the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the old Teſtament were not<note n="g" place="margin">Iewiſh Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments not figures of Chriſtian Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

Now the 5. other Sacraments newly inuented, were not prefigured in the law, they ſucceed not in the place of their ceremonies, they are not anſwerable to any types of Iewiſh rudiments, therefore they are no Sacraments.</p>
               <p>Fiftly, theſe two Sacraments, Baptiſme and the Lords Supper, are altogether perfect and ſufficient, not onely to enter and plant a Chriſtian into the Church, but alſo to retaine him in it: and therfore all other are friuolous, vaine, and ſuperſtitious, as ſuperfluous branches to bee pared away. Now that they are ſufficient to theſe purpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, appeareth by the effects &amp; vſes of them, What other grace can we haue then to be borne againe in Chriſt, to haue iuſtification, forgiuenes of ſins, and all priuiledges of eternall life, and then afterward to be nouriſhed and kept continually in him? All theſe are fully repreſented and ſealed vp to vs in theſe two: whereupon it follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, that Chriſt who ordained the feweſt and beſt Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments vnder the Goſpell, appointed theſe and no moe. Thus then wee may gather, that by the inſtitution of Chriſt, by the argument of the Apoſtle, by compariſon of the Iewiſh ceremonies, and by the ſufficiency of the two Sacraments of Baptiſme and the Lords Supper, that theſe are the onely two Sacraments; the reſt are forged and counterfeit Sacraments, they ſeale not vp Chriſt,<note n="q" place="margin">Auguſt. in Pſal. <hi>40.</hi>

               <p>Againe, heereby we may perceiue and conceiue the <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Vſe </seg>2</label> difference betweene the olde and new Teſtament, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene the Sacraments vnder the lawe and theſe vnder the Goſpell,<note n="k" place="margin">Difference betweene the Sacraments of the old Teſtament &amp; the new.</note> betweene thoſe giuen to the Iewes and theſe retained among Chriſtians. For ours are few in number, theirs are many in number; the Arke, Circumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, the Paſſeouer, Manna, the Cloud, the Sea, the Rock, many purifications &amp; oblations which are not eaſy to be numbred. But the Goſpell acknowledgeth onely two, as two twins begotten of the ſame father, &amp; brought forth of the ſame mother. Hereunto we may adde not vnprofi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tably, other materiall differences to bee acknowledged. They differ in time: ours ſhew forth our communio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> with Chriſt already come, and ſo are more firme and durable, as thoſe<note n="l" place="margin">1 Cor. 11, 26</note> which are not to be changed to the ende of the world, 1 Cor. 11. <hi>Yee ſhew the Lords death till hee come.</hi> Their Sacraments were ordained onely vntill the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming of Chriſt, becauſe they ſhewed and pointed out Chriſt to come, ſo that the worke of grace was more obſcure vnto them. Againe, they differ much in va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety of Sacramentall ſignes and rites, as the cutting of the fore-skinne, the Lambe of the Paſſeouer, iour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nying through the Sea, ſauing by the Arke, drinking of
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:21092:74"/> the rocke, lifting vp the brazen Serpent, raining downe of <hi>Manna,</hi> waſhing of their body; they had calues, ſheep, goates, doues, bread, wine, oyle, and ſuch like: we haue onely water in Baptiſme, &amp; bread and wine in the Lords Supper. Thus the ſignes do greatly vary. Fourthly, they differ in eaſineſſe. For the ceremonies committed to the people of the <hi>Iewes</hi> were hard, cumberſome, pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to the fleſh, and ſome of them were adminiſtred with effuſion and ſhedding of blood, partly of man &amp; partly of beaſts. Of man, as in circumciſion: of beaſts, as in the Paſchall Lambe and in the ſacrifices. But our Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, though Sacraments of Chriſts blood ſhed for vs, yet of themſelues be voide of blood. Fiftly, they dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer in meaſure of ſignification, For our Sacraments haue a more plentifull and full repreſentation of grace offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, and ſtirre vp a greater meaſure of faith then the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments of the old Teſtament (which were more darke &amp; obſcure) the Lord reſeruing a fuller meaſure of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge vnto the bleſſed times of the Goſpell. For as the exhibiting of Chriſt Ieſus in the fleſh in fulneſſe of time, and as it were in the olde age of the world, is of more efficacy to moue vs then the expectation of him to come, ſo wee haue better helpes and an holye aduantage to raiſe and rouſe vp our faith vnto a greater aſſurance of grace and mercy, by how much the accompliſhment is more then the promiſe, and the fulfilling greater then the foretelling.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, they differ in reſpect of the people to whom they were giuen, and for whom they were ordained: ours belong to all people diſperſed ouer the face of the whole earth (that are ingrafted into the Church) wheras theirs were tyed to one Nation, to one people, to one place, to the poſterity of <hi>Abraham.</hi> Notwithſtanding theſe diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences which are in ſignes and circumſtances: touching the chiefe thing euen the matter and ſubſtance of the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments they are equall,<note n="m" place="margin">Wherin the Sacraments of the old and new Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

They ſignifie and ſhew foorth the ſame Communion of Chriſt, by which all the elect are ſaued, and ſeale vp ſaluation and remiſsion of ſinnes to all that do receiue them by faith. For they were giuen to be ſignes and ſeales of grace and of the promiſes of God, to diſtinguiſh the faithfull from all other ſects and religions in the world, and that they ſhould be receiued with profite onely of the faithfull. In theſe and ſuch like things, the Sacraments of the Iewiſh and Chriſtian Church are not vnequal: although in the outward ſigns and circumſtances they be diuers, yet in the ſubſtance &amp; in the thing ſignified there is no difference.</p>

Mat. 3, 8.</note> inward ſorrow for our ſinnes, in an hatred of them, in ſuppreſsing the corruptio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s of nature, in a purpoſe to obey God, in a care to forſake our ſins, in confeſsing the greatneſſe of them, in condemning our ſelues for them, in acknowledging the deſart of them, in an holy indignation and anger a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt our ſelues, that we haue beene ſo careleſſe in loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king to our owne waies, in fearing leaſt we runne into the ſame ſins againe, in deſiring euer hereafter to pleaſe God, and to walke more carefully before him in zeale touching the ſeruice of God, and in taking reuenge
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:21092:78"/> ſometimes and puniſhment vpon our ſelues for former offences. For we confeſſe plainely and deny not, but ſome outward penalties and chaſtiſements of the body may be vſed and do pleaſe God, not of themſelues, but becauſe they are profitable meanes and good helpes to further and forward true repentance. As for example, he that hath offended grieuouſly in ſurfetting &amp; drunk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enneſſe, and hath great heauineſſe of heart and ſorrow of minde that he hath ſinned againſt ſo gracious a God and mercifull Father: may preſcribe and appoint to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe without appearance of ſuperſtition, or error of ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction, or opinion of merite, ſome faſting or abſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence for a certaine time, that he may bee better fitted to Gods ſeruice, and further ſtrengthened againſt thoſe ſinnes into which he is fallen. This doctrine we receiue as the doctrine of Chriſt, and agreeable to the Prophets and Apoſtles, as appeareth, 2 Cor. 7. where <hi>Paul</hi> ſetteth downe the effects or fruites of true repentance. This is our doctrine and the doctrine of the Church of God, touching repentance: let vs conſider a little the popiſh penance and what they teach touching it, and we ſhall ſee plainely, that heauen and earth, light and darkneſſe are not more oppoſite then their deuices and inuenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons are to the truth. For they haue forged a new Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament which they cal Penance,<note place="margin">What popiſh penance is.</note> when a man is contrite for all his ſinnes, and maketh a full and ſufficient recko<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning vp &amp; rehearſall of them all in the eare of the Prieſt, of whom he is enioyned to make ſatisfaction after he is abſolued of them: So that this new coyned Sacrament conſiſteth of theſe foure counterfeit parts,<note place="margin">The parts of popiſh pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance.</note> the contrition of the heart, the confeſsion of the mouth, the ſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the worke, and the abſolution of the Prieſt. Thus they abuſe the name of a Sacrament, when they apply it to theſe things, as we ſhall ſee afterward. Againe, they require all theſe things as neceſſary to ſaluation in all that are of yeares of diſcretion, whereby they lay ſnares for mens ſoules and ſet them vpon the racke, requiring
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:21092:78"/> an impoſsibility at their hands, foraſmuch as no man can haue perfect ſorrow, nor number vp all his ſinnes, nor yet make ſatisfaction for them, and therefore this Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance is not a boord to eſcape ſhipwracke, neyther phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicke for the ſoule, but the high way to deſperation. Laſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, they make the performance of all theſe things meri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious, and teach that remiſsion of ſinnes is obtained by them; which tendeth to the reproach and diſhonour of Chriſt. Let vs ſpeake ſomewhat of theſe in order.</p>
               <p>Touching the firſt point, to wit, Contrition, we grant that godly ſorrow of heart for ſinne is neceſſary to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, as alſo to haue a true feeling of ſinne, and an hatred and deteſtation of it: howbeit it is no part the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, but onely the right and ready way that lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth to it, becauſe the more ſinne doth preſſe vs and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict vs, the more we learne to flye to the mercy of God in his Sonne Chriſt. But they teach that this Contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ought to be perfect, and that the greatneſſe of the griefe muſt be anſwerable and equiualent to the gree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uouſneſſe of the ſinne; they make it a neceſſary meane and cauſe of iuſtification, and apart of ſatisfaction for our ſinnes, that we deſerue by it remiſsion of them; and therefore their doctrine is diueliſh and blaſphemous, tranſlating vnto mortall and ſinfull men, that which is proper to Chriſt the Son of God.</p>
               <p>The next point is Confeſsion. Such as the Scripture alloweth and approueth, we admit and acknowledge; as firſt, publike confeſsion of the whole Church, acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledging the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues before the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gregation to be grieuous ſinners in the ſight of God, conſenting to the Miniſter that conceiueth the prayer, and crauing pardon of our heauenly Father in the name of Chriſt our Sauiour. This is practiſed continually of al the faithfull met together, they begin the exerciſes of religion with this publike humiliation, Nehe. 9, 3.<note place="margin">Nehe. 9, 3.</note> For whereſoeuer two or three are gathered together in his name, where he is in the midſt of them, there is alwayes confeſsion of ſinne: for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſmuch
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:21092:79"/> as there is nothing can with-hold good things from vs, but our owne vnworthineſſe. Secondly, there is a priuate confeſsion, when a man poureth out his hart before God alone, and deſireth forgiueneſſe of his ſins. This did <hi>Dauid,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Pſal. 32, 5, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>1.1.2. Luke 18.</note> this did the <hi>Publican</hi> practiſe: and ſo doth euery beleeuing ſoule almoſt at all times. For we do all of vs finde continuall occaſions to poure out our meditations before him, to keepe vs from ſinne, to hold vs vp in tentations, and to weaken the power of ſin daily in vs. Thirdly, there is another confeſsion, when ſuch as are baniſhed from the Church, and excluded from the Sacraments, and excommunicated out of the ſociety of the faithfull, do openly acknowledge their offences, and deſire to be reconciled to the Church, which they haue notoriouſly offended, as we ſee in the example of the inceſtuous <hi>Corinthian,</hi> 2 Cor. 2.6.<note place="margin">2 Cor. 2, 6.</note> who humbled himſelfe before God, &amp; asked forgiuenes of the Church. Fourth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, there is a kinde of confeſsion of ſuch as haue offended their brethren; not that which wee mentioned before, belonging to eccleſiaſticall diſcipline: but a priuate ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgement of the iniuries and wrongs done vnto them, and a crauing of forgiuenes at their hands, which duty the offenders are bound to performe, and the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended are bound to grant, according to the rule of cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity.<note place="margin">Mat. 5, 24, and 6, 14. and 18.15.</note> For we are all charged to reconcile our ſelues vnto our brethren, and to forgiue as we deſire to be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giuen. Laſtly, there is a lawfull and lawdable kind of confeſsion, pertaining to ſuch as are troubled in conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence for ſinne, and deſire to finde comfort, and to be at peace with God. Theſe are to make confeſsion of that particular ſinne which lyeth heauy vpon their heart, ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to the Miniſter, if he haue the tongue of the lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, and bee able to miniſter a word of comfort in ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon;<note place="margin">Iam. 5.16.</note> or to ſome other faithfull and godly brother, that their ſpirits may be raiſed vp &amp; refreſhed by their pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers. All there ſorts of confeſsion we know to be good, and therefore receiue: but what are they to the auricu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:21092:79"/> confeſsion ſecretly whiſpered in the eare of an igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant and ſottiſh Prieſt, wherein men are enioyned to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe all particularly, at the leaſt all their mortall ſins,<note place="margin">Rhem. annot. vpon Iohn <hi>20.</hi>
                  </note> whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they be committed in minde, heart, will, and cogita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion onely, or elſe in word and worke, with all the neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary circumſtances and differences of the ſame. This they will have done once a yeare, in the holy time of Lent, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Lords Supper bee receiued at Eaſter. This is a meere inuention of carnal men, not an inſtitution of God: foraſmuch as Chriſt neyther by commandment, neyther by example ordained any ſuch auricular Confeſsion or particular enumeration of all our ſinnes; of which we ſhal ſpeake further in the third booke, where we intreat of the preparation required of ſuch as come to the Table of the Lord.</p>
               <p>The third point is ſatisfaction; and it is true that the iuſtice of God muſt be ſatisfied, foraſmuch as hee can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer forget to be iuſt: but it is folly and madnes, blockiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and ſencelesneſſe, nay high preſumption and blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemy for fleſh and blood to thinke that they can make recompence to God for their ſins and fully ſatisfie his iuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice. For who is able to beare the burthen of his wrath?<note place="margin">Pſal. 90.11.</note> For who can pay a price ſufficient for his ſinnes? or who dare offer to the righteous God the rags and patches of his owne workes, to merite thereby his fauour? What is the ſprinkling of holy water, the building of Churches, the erecting of Monaſteries, the mumbling vp of prayers, the lighting of Candles, the giuing of almes, the putting on of ſacke-cloth, the chaſtiſing of the bodge, the ſaying of Maſſes, the buying of indulgences, the going on pilgri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mages, and ſuch like ſuperſtitious vanities and impieties; what I ſay, do all theſe auaile to make ſatisfactiOn to God for the ſinne of our ſoules? And when it ſhall be ſaid vnto them, <hi>Who required theſe things at your hands?</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Eſay 1, 12.</note> what ſhall they be able to anſwere? nay when it ſhall be ſaid, I deteſt and abhorre your deuiſes and dotages, what can they finde out to mutter or vtter in defence of themſelues? Then
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:21092:80"/> they ſhall be taken ſpeechleſſe, and haue nothing to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere for themſelues Our ſatisfaction to God is on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Chriſts ſatisfaction (which is perfect and abſolute, &amp; imputed to vs by faith) <hi>who of God is made vnto vs wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome and righteouſneſſe, ſanctification and redemption,</hi> 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 1, 30.<note place="margin">1 Cor. 1, 30.</note> As for the popiſh ſatisfaction, it is not to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued for theſe cauſes: firſt becauſe they affirme that it ſtandeth with the iuſtice of God to retaine the puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment after the ſinne committed is forgiuen. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, they hold that the temporall puniſhments of this life due to ſinne, may be bought out, and redeemed by our good workes. Thirdly, they teach that it is not ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to beleeue that Chriſt hath fully ſatisfied for vs, who notwithſtanding was made <hi>ſinne for vs which knew no ſinne,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">2 Cor. 5, 21.</note> 
                  <hi>that we ſhould bee made the righteouſneſſe of God in him,</hi> neither that it is enough to amend our liues; but that God muſt be ſatisfied by vs for our ſins in our owne perſons, by the puniſhment and chaſtiſement of our ſelues; as by penance enioyned by the Prieſt, or by prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, faſtings, almes, chaſtiſements, and ſuch like ſhewes of wiſedome,<note place="margin">Col. 2, 23.</note> 
                  <hi>in voluntary religion and humbleneſſe of mind, and in not ſpring the body, which are things of no value, ſith they pertaine to the filling of the fleſh, Col.</hi> 2.23. Laſtly, they auouch that ſatisfaction by this will-worſhip is not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly profitable to the ſufferers themſelues, but alſo auaile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able for others, ſo that one man may beare the burthen and diſcharge the debt of another, one man may merite and ſatisfie for another. The very naming of theſe im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pieties and abſurdities is ſufficient to ouerthrow them, and to make vs to deteſt them.</p>
               <p>The laſt point is abſolution ariſing from the former, wherein ſtandeth the life of this dead Sacrament. For when the penitent hath performed all the former, his contrition, his confeſsion, and his ſatisfaction, he is by the Prieſt fully abſolued of his ſins, albeit he know no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of the doctrine of hatred of ſinne, of amendment of life, and of flying to the mercy of God and the merite
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:21092:80"/> of Chriſt his Sonne, without which there can bee no true repentance. Beſides, theſe three ſuppoſed and preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted parts of Penance, may be found in the reprobate, as we ſee in <hi>Iudas,</hi> who had their contrition, for he was ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowfull: their confeſsion, for he ſaid, <hi>Mathew</hi> 27, 4.<note place="margin">Mat. 27 4.</note> 
                  <hi>I haue ſinned in betraying innocent blood:</hi> and their ſatisfaction, for he brought backe againe the curſed mony that he had taken, and caſt it downe in the Temple: and yet hee was farre from true repentance, as appeareth in this, that hee went out immediately, and hanged himſelfe. Thus we haue heard at large, what the popiſh Penance is.</p>
               <p>Now the queſtion<note place="margin">Penance no Sacrament.</note> ariſeth betweene the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> and vs, whether this repentance which is a dying to ſinne, and a walking in newneſſe of life, and whether re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciliation to the Church and abſolution from ſinne be a Sacrament of the new Teſtament, inſtituted by Chriſt, to aſſure his ſauing graces to vs? We anſwere it is not. Firſt, it was in time of the old Teſtament from the beginning of mans fall and tranſgreſsion: it was continually preached and publiſhed by the Prophets, and therefore before Chriſts comming in the fleſh, and cannot bee a Sacrament of the new Teſtament.</p>
               <p>Secondly, it wanteth an outward ſigne ſuch as water in Baptiſme, ſuch as bread and wine in the Lords Supper: now euery Sacrament muſt haue an outward element and ſigne to repreſent the ſpirituall grace: therefore Penance can be no Sacrament.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, it hath no word to command it, no particular promiſe of God, which is the chiefe ſtay and ſtaffe of a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament. <hi>Bellarmine</hi> affirmeth, that<note n="d" place="margin">Bellar. lib. <hi>1.</hi> de poenit. ca. <hi>10</hi>
                  </note> Chriſt inſtituted the Sacrament of Penance, when bee breathed upon his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles after his reſurrection, and ſaid vnto them,<note n="e" place="margin">Ioh. 20.22.</note> 
                  <hi>Receiue the Holy-Ghoſt, whoſe ſinnes ye rem't they are remitted, and whoſe ſins ye retaine they are retained.</hi> And he ſaith, the words of abſolution are the ſigne, and that remiſsion of ſinnes is the promiſe of grace which is ſignified. For anſwere to this aſſertion, would gladly aske this queſtion, whether the Apoſtles had this miniſterial power to forgiue ſinnes to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentant
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:21092:81"/> ſinners, when they baptized to remiſsion of ſins, if this power were heere firſt inſtituted and giuen vnto them? Do they not by tying the authority of remitting ſins to this time, make their baptiſme of none effect? Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, we haue ſhewed that it is not ſufficient to haue a ſound of words that may bee heard, to make an outward ſigne: there muſt be a viſible ſigne that may be ſeene, to warrant a Sacrament. Now to make a Sacrament without ſuch a ſigne, were to make a Sacrament without a Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Laſtly, as they take and vnderſtand Penance, it is neither Sacrament, nor ſacred: it is neither holy ſigne, nor holy thing: it is neyther an inſtitution of God, nor any way of God. For they meane not thereby amendment of life, or inward ſorrow and griefe of minde for the life paſt, which is ſometimes teſtified by weeping and mourning, by ſacke-cloth and aſhes, by faſting and humiliation: but they vnderſtand by Penance and externall diſcipline, ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction for our ſins to God by our owne ſufferings: and that wearing of ſacke-cloth, ſprinkling of aſhes, chaſtiſing of the body, whipping of the fleſh, putting on rough ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parell, lying on boords and hard places, abſtaining from fleſh, and afflicting our ſelues by ſuch outward exerciſes, are a paying of the paines due to ſin, part of amends made to Gods iuſtice, and meritorious before him. This puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, this Penance, theſe penalties we abhorre, as an hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible blaſphemy againſt the blood of Chriſt, which is the onely ſatisfaction to God for ſinne. For if wee ſatisfie for our ſelues, then hath not Chriſt ſatisfied for vs, nor payed the price due vnto our ſins. Beſides, they charge God the Father with iniuſtice, in that hauing laid the guiltineſſe of our ſins vpon his owne Sonne, and puniſhed them in him, they make him not ſatisfied with that puniſhment, but to exact the debt of vs againe, for which his Son as our ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty hath fully and ſufficiently anſwered,<note n="f" place="margin">Eſa. 53, 5, 7.</note>

                  <hi>If any ſhall ſay, that Matrimony is not truely and properly one of the</hi> 7. <hi>Sacraments inſtituted by Chriſt, but was brought in by men into the Church, and doth not confer grace let him be accur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed.</hi> Heereby they would ſeeme to ſet forth the dignity of marriage aboue vs, ſeeing they lift it vp into the number of the Sacraments of the Church. Yet (as a lyar ſeldome a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeth with himſelfe) they complaine that we too highly magnifie the married eſtate, and themſelues cannot abide it in their Clergy, becauſe forſooth it is written, <hi>Be ye holy for I am holy:</hi> and <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. <hi>They which are in the fleſh cannot pleaſe God.</hi> Marriage therefore is too holy an ordinance for their vnholy Clergy, inaſmuch as they teach in this point<note n="b" place="margin">1 Tim. 4.1.2, 3.</note> the doctrine of diuels, and are led by the ſpirite of error, that forbid marriage which God hath left free. We con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe touching marriage, ſo much as the word of God tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth vs, that it is an ordinance of God, inſtituted before the fall of man while hee was without ſinne,<note n="c" place="margin">Gen. 2.18.</note> and bleſſed of God, who ſaid, <hi>It is not good for man to be alone, let vs make him an helper meete for him.</hi> This eſtate Chriſt did not abro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate and diſanull, but repeated and confirmed,<note n="d" place="margin">Mat. 19, 16. Iohn 2, 1, 2. Heb. 13, 4. 1 Cor. 6.9.10.</note> not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by word, but by his owne preſence, and hath left it as a lawfull remedy againſt fornication and vncleannes. We account it an honourable eſtate of life among all, and the bed vndefiled, but whoremongers and adulterers God wil iudge, and caſt into vtter darkeneſſe, where their worme
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:21092:82"/> ſhall neuer dye, and their fire ſhall not be quenched; as the Apoſtle teacheth, 1 Cor. 6. <hi>Know ye not that the vnrighteous ſhall not inherit the kingdome of God? Be not deceiued: neither fornicators, nor Idolaters, nor adulterers, nor wantons, nor bug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerers, nor drunkards, ſhall inherite the kingdome of God.</hi> Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding,<note n="e" place="margin">Reaſons why marriage is no Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</note> we cannot cal and account it a Sacrament, for diuers weighty reaſons, and euident cauſes. Firſt, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it was not inſtituted by Chriſt, but was from the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of the world, and therefore it was before the law and vnder the law, how can it bee a Sacrament of the new Teſtament? Againe, matrimony may be among Infidels &amp; vnbeleeuers, out of the Church and ſociety of the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full. For the matrimony of Infidels is lawfull. God did inſtitute it for all mankinde. The commandement is ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall, Increaſe and multiply. The Apoſtle teacheth, that if the vnbeleeuing woman will dwell with the beleeuing husband,<note n="f" place="margin">Grati. in dec. c. <hi>28.</hi> qu <hi>1.</hi> Lumb. lib <hi>4.</hi> diſt. <hi>39.</hi>
                  </note> he muſt not put her away for her infidelity: and marriage is honourable among all perſons. Seeing ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it was before the fall of man, before the giuing of the law, vnder the gouernment of the law, and made honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable among all, it cannot bee a Sacrament of the Church of Chriſt, and for the members only of the Church. Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, it is not common and commanded to all the faithfull, for it is not needfull and neceſſary that all in the Church ſhould be married.<note n="g" place="margin">1 Cor. 7.7. Mat. 19, 11, 12.</note> Euery one hath his proper gift, ſome one way, ſome another. And albeit God haue not tyed grace to the Sacraments, yet they in ſome ſort<note n="h" place="margin">H<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ments are neceſſary for the Church.</note> are neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary for the Church, and to be partaked of the children of the Church, whether wee reſpect the commandement of God who requireth them: or whether we regard our own weakeneſſe, who ſtand in need of all holy meanes and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable helpes that tend to the confirmation of our faith. Seeing then matrimony is not commanded to all, neither ſerueth to confirme faith, it cannot be receiued as a Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Fourthly, the Sacraments are ordinances of God, applying Chriſt and his merites to all the faithfull: but matrimony is not an inſtrument whereby God apply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth Chriſt and all his benefites: much leſſe is it a common
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:21092:82"/> inſtrument of the common ſaluation and benefits that all haue in Chriſt Ieſus. Furthermore, we haue ſhewed how the Romane Church is contrary to it ſelfe in this point: for our aduerſaries cal matrimony a prophanation<note n="i" place="margin">Greg. Mart. diſ. Chap. <hi>15.</hi>
                  </note> of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly orders. And<note n="k" place="margin">Pigghius.</note> another ſaith, it is more tollerable for a Prieſt to keepe many Concubines, then to marry, If matri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony be an holy Sacrament, how ſhould the ſacred order of your Prieſt-hood be prophaned, polluted, and defiled thereby? Laſtly, it hath no promiſe of ſaluation ioyned to it (as it ought to haue) though it bee lawfull and vſed lawfully: in euery Sacrament there muſt bee likewiſe an outward ſigne or element, as water in Baptiſme, and bread and wine in the Lords Supper, together with a ſanctify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing word to warrant it: but in this ſuppoſed Sacrament there is neither matter, nor word, therefore no Sacrament. Hence it is, that <hi>Durandus</hi> one of their owne Doctours ſaith, that Matrimony in a ſtrict &amp; proper kinde of ſpeech is no Sacrament at all. The anſwere that <hi>Bellarmine</hi> maketh to this laſt reaſon is as abſurd as their doctrine it ſelfe, namely, that the word of inſtitution in mariage is,<note n="l" place="margin">Bellar. lib. <hi>1.</hi> de Matrim. c. <hi>6.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>I take thee,</hi> which are the words expreſsing their mutuall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent: and that the matter or ſigne are the parties married. For not euery word can conſecrate and ſanctifie,<note n="m" place="margin">1 Tim. 4, 5.</note> but the word of God. Againe, the married perſons are receiuers of this pretended and ſuppoſed Sacrament, ſo that they cannot be the matter or ſigne: For the ſigne and the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiuer are two diſtinct outward parts of a Sacrament, ſo that they cannot be confounded or mingled together, as before we declared, Chap. 3. The matter cannot be the receiuer: the receiuer cannot be the matter. The thing receiued, cannot be the receiuer: the receiuer cannot bee the thing receiued. If then the perſons married be the receiuers, they cannot be the ſigne receiued. If any fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther obiect &amp; ſay, Marriage is the ſigne of an holy thing, to wit, of the ſpirituall coniunction betweene Chriſt and his Church: I anſwere, it was not inſtituted to confirme our faith in that point, but for other ends which we na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med before. Beſides, if we ſhold cal al ſigns of holy things
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:21092:83"/> Sacraments; we ſhould treble the number of ſeauen; for ſo many compariſons as we finde in Scripture, wee ſhould haue Sacraments: and then the Stars, a graine of muſtard-ſeede, leauen, a draw-net, a ſhepheard, a Vine, a doore, nay a theefe, a murtherer, and infinite other things, ſhould be Sacraments; which ſometimes are made ſignes of holy things. This were not ſo much to increaſe the number of Sacraments, as to multiply abſurdities. Laſtly, the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baoth was ordained to the Iewes to be a ſigne betweene God and his people in their generations,<note n="n" place="margin">Heb. 4, 8.</note> &amp; ſignified the ſpirituall reſt in Chriſt, yet was it no ordinary Sacrament, albeit it were bleſſed and ſanctified of God. Wherefore all myſticall and ſignifying ſignes are not Sacraments.</p>
               <p>But the greateſt reaſon whereof they are moſt confident is, where the vulgar tranſlation and the Rhemiſh interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation<note n="o" place="margin">Eph. 5, 32.</note> readeth, <hi>This is a great Sacrament.</hi> I anſwere, firſt the word ſignifieth a myſtery or ſecret: but not euery my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery or ſecret is a Sacrament: neyther will they admit a Sacrament, whereſoeuer a myſtery is named. Secondly, the Apoſtle ſpeaketh not of Matrimony, but of the ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall coniunction betweene Chriſt and his Church, as the words following do declare, <hi>This is a great myſtery: but I ſpeake of Chriſt and of the Church.</hi> Where the Apoſtle pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenteth this very obiection, and ſheweth in what reſpect he ſpake of a myſtery. For where one might haply ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect and ſay, Doeſt thou call marriage this myſtery? he an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwereth, I ſpeake not this of Marriage, I ſpeake it in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of Chriſt and of his Church. This appeareth like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe in that he calleth it <hi>a great myſtery;</hi> that is, A great ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret. But the coniunction of man and wife is ſenſible, not ſecret, much leſſe a great ſecret. Now the Sacraments are called myſteries,<note n="p" place="margin">Why ſacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments are called myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries.</note> in reſpect of the Sacramental vnion betweene the ſigne and the thing ſignified, betweene the repreſentation and the thing repreſented; ſo that at the ſame inſtant that one is preſent to the eyes, the hands, the mouth, and euery part and member of the body: the other by the power and working of Gods Spirit is as preſent in a wonderfull, myſticall, and ſecret manner to the faith, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:21092:83"/> the eyes and hands of the ſoule. Wherefore Cardinall <hi>Caietan</hi> not ſo groſſe as many among them,<note n="q" place="margin">Caiet in Eph. cap. <hi>5.</hi>
                  </note> confeſſeth that theſe words proue not matrimony to be a Sacrament. Further, it is euident to all that conſider the circumſtance of the text, that the Apoſtle brings not forth marriage in this place as a ſimilitude to repreſent the neere coniuncti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on betweene Chriſt and his Church,<note n="r" place="margin">Eph. 5, 23, 25 28, 29, 32.</note> but contrariwiſe he bringeth forth the exceeding and eminent loue of Chriſt as a ſimilitude to declare and enforce what ſhould be the loue of the husband toward the wife. For the maine point of exhortation is ſet downe, verſe 25. <hi>Husbands loue your wiues.</hi> This is argued and enforced by the example of Chriſt, <hi>As Chriſt loued the Church and gaue himſelfe for it.</hi> Againe, <hi>The man is the head of the woman, as Chriſt is the head of the Church:</hi> and afterward, <hi>He that loueth his wife, loueth himſelfe, for no man euer yet hated his owne fleſh, but nouriſheth and cheriſheth it, euen as the Lord doth the Church.</hi> By all theſe things it is plaine and manifeſt, that if they will needes in this place dreame of a Sacrament, conſiſting of a ſigne and thing ſignified: Chriſt and the Church muſt be the ſigne, repreſentation, and conſecrated myſtery to repreſent man and his wife, and their mutuall loue each to other, and not marriage a conſecrated ſigne of him. Laſt of all, I would know of them, whether ſo often as the old tranſlator vſeth the word Sacrament, they will haue it taken ſtrictly, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly and particularly for the Sacraments of their church? I thinke if they be ſober minded and well aduiſed, they dare not ſay ſo: for<note n="ſ" place="margin">1 Tim. 3.16. Eph. 1, 9, and cha. 3, 9. Reuel. 17, 7.</note> then godlineſſe ſhal be a Sacrament, Gods will ſhall be a Sacrament, the calling of the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles ſhal be a Sacrament, yea iniquity ſhal be a Sacrament. For in all theſe places the word Sacrament is vſed, as well as in this place to the <hi>Epheſians</hi> by the old Interpreter, &amp; ſometimes in the good part, and ſometimes in the euill:<note n="t" place="margin">Conc.

                  </note>But the popiſh orders of the popiſh Church, they ſay are ſeauen, whereof ſome are greater and higher offices, ſome are lower, leſſer, and inferior. The greater are three, the office of Prieſt-hood to offer vp the ſacrifice of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy and blood of Chriſt vpon the Altar: of Deaconſhip, to aſsiſt the Prieſts in all things which are done in the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, to bring in the oblations, to ſet them vpon the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar, to couer it with cloathes, to beare the Croſſe, and to reade the Goſpell and Epiſtle to the people: of the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deacons, to bring the chalice and patten, to bring the cruet with water and the towell to the Altar, &amp; to poure out water to waſh their hands. Theſe are their higher Offices aboue the reſt, as the higher trees among the low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er ſhrubs. The leſſer orders are foure in number. Firſt,
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:21092:84"/> of doore-keepers, theſe receiue the keyes of the Church doore to open the ſame. Secondly of readers, to reade the Bible to the people. Thirdly of Exorciſtes, to call vpon the name of the Lord, ouer ſuch as haue vncleane ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rites, adiuring and coniuring them to come out in the name of God: which power of commanding euill ſpirits is ceaſed in the Church. Laſtly, Acolythes, to prepare and carry torches and tapers when the Goſpell is read to the people, or the ſacrifice is to be offered.</p>
               <p>Theſe ſeauen popiſh orders, or rather plaine diſorders and confuſions, we cannot receiue<note n="d" place="margin">Reaſons ren<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>dred why or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders are no Sacraments.</note> into the number of Sacraments of the Church. For firſt, orders are ſo fruite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, that this Bird hath hatched ſeauen young ones. This Sacrament is ſo rich, ſo ranke, ſo riotous, that it hath in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gendered and brought forth ſeauen petty and pretty Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments, and therfore theſe being numbred and patched vp to the former, we ſhould haue 13. Sacraments. A good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly brood of a gallant egge. For if euery one of theſe orders of doore-keepers, readers, exorciſtes, Acolythes, ſubdea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cons, deacons, and Prieſts be Sacraments: we ſhould mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiply the number of Sacraments according to the number of theſe orders, and ſo indeed of ſeauen wee ſhould haue 13. Sacraments, which were a very diſorderly order, or if you liſt to call it, an orderly diſorder.</p>
               <p>And ſo <hi>Peter Lumbard</hi> maiſter of the Sentences,<note n="e" place="margin">Sent lib. <hi>4.</hi> diſt. <hi>24,</hi> cap. <hi>1.</hi>
                  </note> cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth not orders a Sacrament as ſpeaking of one, but Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments as ſpeaking of many, ſaying, <hi>Orders are called Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, becauſe in receiuing of them grace is conferred, which is repreſented by thoſe things that are there performed.</hi> Neyther can they ſay they all make but one Sacrament, ſeeing they are diſtinct offices one from another, diuers in offices, in inſtitution, in calling, in ordination, in ceremonies, and in forme of conſecration: ſo that they may by as good right and as great reaſon make baptiſme and the Lordes Supper one Sacrament, as all theſe orders, ſo diuers and diſtinct the one from the other.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Sacraments haue their inſtitution from Chriſt: Orders haue not their inſtitution from Chriſt to bee Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:21092:85"/> of the Church: therefore Orders are no Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Nay as they are retained and vſed in the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> they are no ordinance or inſtitution of Chriſt at all. For touching the offices of Prieſt-hood to offer vp the body of Chriſt for the quicke and dead: of deacons to ſerue theſe Baals Prieſts at their Idolatrous altars: of ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deacons, of readers, and of the reſt, they are not found in Scripture, neyther were ordained by the Apoſtles, neither were they receiued into the Church for many yeares after Chriſt and his Apoſtles. The new Teſtament as it doth acknowledge no other ſacrificer and ſacrifice but Chriſt, ſo it admitteth no Prieſts, no Prieſt-hood, but ſpirituall Prieſts and a ſpirituall Prieſt-hood to offer vp ſpirituall ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices of praiſe &amp; thankſgiuing vnto God, as appeareth:<note n="f" place="margin">Reuel. 1, 6. 1 Pet. 2, 5.9.</note> 
                  <hi>Chriſt hath waſhed vs from our ſinnes in his blood, and made vs Kings and Priests vnto God euen his Father.</hi> And the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle <hi>Peter</hi> in his firſt Epiſtle, Chap. 2. ſaith, <hi>Ye alſo as liuely stones be made a ſpirituall houſe, an holy Priest-hood, to offer vp ſpirituall ſacrifices acceptable to God by Ieſus Chriſt.</hi> And a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine afterward, <hi>Ye are a choſen generation, a royall Prieſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, an holy Nation, a people ſet at liberty, that yee ſhould ſhew foorth the vertues of him that hath called you out of darkeneſſe into his maruailous light.</hi> Whoſoeuer bringeth in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Prieſt-hood then this, and maketh new Prieſts, abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſheth as much as in him lyeth the Prieſt-hood of Chriſt. Againe, what will they ſay of offices and dignities in the Church greater then theſe, the office of Pope, of Cardinal, of Patriarch, and the reſt of that vnholy hierarchy? Will they diſcharge and cut off theſe from beeing Sacraments, and aduance the baſer orders of hedge-Prieſts, and dumbe Deacons to ſo high a dignity? What? Do they abaſe and diſgrace thoſe greater places, and thinke their Popes and Cardinals not worthy of that honour and authority? Or do they thinke this Sacrament too vile and baſe to agree to thoſe Prince-like dignities of the Church? Or dare they preferre their Prieſt-hood, their Readers, their Dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cons, their doore-keepers, their dog-keepers, and the reſt of that rabble before the Popedome, the Cardinalſhip,
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:21092:85"/> the Patriarchſhip? Is not this high treaſon againſt their holy father, and petty treaſon againſt the Cardinals and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of that generation? Laſtly, Sacraments muſt haue an outward element and word of inſtitution, as hath beene often declared and prooued: but their orders haue neither outward element, nor word of inſtitution: therefore Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders are no Sacraments. Seeing therefore they can ſhew no material ſigne added to the promiſe, nor gracious pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe added to the ſigne: there can be no Sacrament of or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders to ſeale vp and aſſure any mercy of God granted vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to vs. To omit that reaſon, which we might preſſe vpon them, namely, that Orders are peculiar and proper to the Miniſtry, and are no ſanctified inſtrument to apply any ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall and common grace of the Church. Wherefore, inaſmuch as Orders haue neither outward ſigne, nor pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe of grace, nor inſtitution from Chriſt, but diſgrace the higher dignities of their Church, and ouerthrow their owne choſen number of ſeauen Sacraments: we conclude neceſſarily from theſe premiſes, that orders are no Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>

                  <hi>If any man ſhall ſay that the Sacraments of the new law were not all inſtituted by Ieſus Chriſt, let him be accurſed.</hi> A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, the place of the Apoſtle <hi>Iames,</hi> maketh nothing for this forged Sacrament: for there is a great difference and contrariety betweene the annointing that <hi>Iames</hi> ſpeaketh of, and the popiſh anealing. Their Prieſts haue not the miraculous guift of healing, whereof this annointing was an outward ſigne in the primitiue Church, which cuſtome afterward ceaſed when the guift of healing ceaſed: being for a time granted to the Church for the credite of the Goſpell. As then the guift was temporall and for a ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, ſo muſt the ſigne be of the ſame ſtanding and conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance: and the guift being taken from the Church, if the ſigne ſhould remaine in vſe and practiſe, it ſhould be but a lying ſigne. For by the ſame reaſon,<note n="f" place="margin">Iohn 5, 4, &amp; 9, 6, 7.</note> the brooke of <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loam,</hi> the poole <hi>Betheſda,</hi> the clay and ſpittle which were ſometimes vſed in healing the diſeaſed, the waſhing of feet, might be accounted Sacraments as well as this, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all ſignes of healing for a certaine ſeaſon, as alſo an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nointing with oyle was for the firſt times of the Church while it was in planting. Thirdly, the Apoſtle would haue all ſicke perſons annointed: theſe do annoint with their greazy oyle, onely ſuch bodyes as are in a manner halfe dead, euen while they lye in extremity, and the life is ſtriuing to come forth. The Apoſtle would haue all the Elders called: but one Maſſe-Prieſt only with them bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the box, and annointeth the ſicke man. The Apoſtle aſſureth health to all that are thus annointed,<note n="g" place="margin">Iam. 5, 14, 15. Mark. 6, 13.</note> 
                  <hi>The prayer of faith ſhall ſaue him that is ſicke, and the Lord ſhall raiſe him vp.</hi> So alſo Mar. 6. <hi>They caſt out many diuels, and they annoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted many that were ſicke with oyle, and healed them:</hi> whereby we ſee, that reſtoring and recouering of health was cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainely
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:21092:86"/> promiſed to follow the annointing. But not one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong many receiueth health after their popiſh annealing. The Apoſtle ſpeaketh of bodily health, of the guift of mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles, and of common oyle: they prattle of forgiuenes of ſins, of a common and continuall guift, of charmed and conſecrate oyle, and balme, (whereof notwithſtanding can none be found) of bowing their knees and ſaluting it, ſaying, <hi>Haile holy oyle, haile holy oyntment, haile holy balme;</hi> nay which is more blaſphemous, their oyle they call <hi>The oyle of ſaluation:</hi> wihch is to renounce ſaluation by Chriſt, and to deny the holy Spirit to ſanctifie the people of God. Furthermore, euery Sacrament muſt haue a word of inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution: but the words which they vſe in annealing are a ſtrange ſalutation of a dumbe and deafe creature, not war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranted nor found in Scripture, as the words of conſecrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in the true Sacraments are: and therefore wee cannot receiue it for a Sacrament, but muſt account it an apiſh imitation and a popiſh tradition. Moreouer, wee haue prooued before, chap. 8. that the element is conſecrated when the Sacrament is miniſtred, by praying, thankſgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing, eating and drinking, deliuering and receiuing, brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king and pouring out, bleſsing, and reciting the inſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: therefore the oyle hallowed long before by the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop, heated with breathing vpon it, charmed with much murmuring, ſaluted with bowing of the knee, and other like trumperies, that hallowing I ſay is fond, ſuperfluous, and ſuperſtitious. Laſtly, the effect and vertue of a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament is ſpirituall grace in Chriſt: but extreme vnction hath no ſpiritual grace in Chriſt ſealed vp: for the Apoſtle aſcribeth<note n="h" place="margin">Iam 5, 16.</note> not the forgiuenes of ſinnes to the annointing with oyle, but to the prayer of faith. <hi>Acknowledge</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>your faults one to another, and pray one for another that yee may be healed, for the prayer of a righteous man auaileth much if it be feruent:</hi> and againe, <hi>The prayer of fa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

We muſt all appeare before the iudgement ſeate<note n="c" place="margin">2 Cor. 5, 10.</note> of Chriſt, that euery one may receiue the things which are done in his bodye, whether good or euill. Put them in remembrance, not to oppreſſe or defraud any man,<note n="d" place="margin">Pſal. 41.5.</note> for the Lord is an auen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of all ſuch things, whoe will not bleſſe euill gotten goods, but ſend his curſe vpon them, and they ſhall not proſper.

Thus we inſtruct men to liue and to dye, that dying they may liue with God in his kingdome. Thus we annoint the ſick with precious balme that<note n="e" place="margin">1 Theſ. 4, 6.</note> ſhal not break their head, &amp; with the inward and inuiſible oyle of Gods grace and mercy. Thus we warne them to prepare the oyle of faith in their lampes, and to keepe a good conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence toward God and man, that they may with ioy and comfort depart in peace, render vp their ſoules into the hands of God, cheerefully meeting the Bride-groome, and entring with him into his kingdome. So then the people looſe nothing by lacke of the materiall oyle, the want thereof beeing ſupplyed with exhortations, admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitions, reproofes, conſolations, prayers, and ſupplica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, more deſired of the ſicke, and more auaileable for the ſicke. And thus much of extreame vnction, and the other forged Sacraments, whereof ſome wanting the outward ſigne, ſome the ſpirituall grace ſignified, ſome the word of inſtitution, ſome the promiſe annexed, and al of them the commandement of Chriſt, the teſtimony of the Scriptures, and the conſent of elder times: we cannot ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit them for any Sacraments; and ſo we conclude, that there are onely two Sacraments of the Church vnder the Goſpell, which are, Baptiſme, and the Supper of the Lord.</p>

<pb n="151" facs="tcp:21092:91"/> So Heb. 9, 10. the old tabernacle did conſiſt in waſhings.

<pb n="152" facs="tcp:21092:92"/> is the firſt Sacrament, whereby, by the outward waſhing of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy with water once into the name of the Father, of the Sonne, and of the Holy-Ghoſt, the inward clenſing of the ſoule by the blood of Christ is repreſented.</hi> This deſcription of baptiſme is to be opened and further expounded vnto vs:<note n="c" place="margin">The deſcrip<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tion of bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme proued.</note> wherein fiue points are to be conſidered of vs. Firſt, it is called the firſt Sacrament, both in reſpect of the other Sacrament of the Lords Supper, and becauſe when the nations were conuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the faith, and beleeued in the name of Chriſt, they were immediately baptized; as wee ſee the practiſe of the Church, <hi>Acts</hi> 2, 4. and chap. 10, 47. and chap. 8, 12. Where after imbracing the faith, we ſee the partaking of baptiſme, and the ſealing vp of their conuerſion.</p>
               <p>Againe, it is ſaide there muſt be an outward waſhing of the body with water, becauſe the<note n="d" place="margin">Eph. 5, 26.</note> Apoſtle declareth ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the nature of the Sacrament of baptiſme, calling it <hi>the waſhing of water through the word;</hi> and it hath a iuſt propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or relation to the ſpiritual waſhing of our new birth, Tit. 3, 5.<note place="margin">Titus 3 5.

Dipping into the water is not neceſſary to the being of a Sacrament: ſprink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of water is not neceſſary to the being of a Sacrament: but wetting and waſhing with water is neceſſary to the being of a Sacrament. Now whether the whole body ſhold be waſhed, or the face onely: and whether it ſhould bee done once or thrice, is not greatly materiall, but left in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different to the Church to decree and determine, what ſhal be thought fitteſt to be receiued and practiſed.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, it is added in the former deſcription, that bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme is once onely to be adminiſtred. For as in naturall generation, man is once onely borne: ſo it is in ſpirituall regeneration. And as circumciſion was once only receiued in the fleſh, whereby the fore-skin was circumciſed: ſo is Baptiſme once onely to be adminiſtred, not oftentimes to be repeated. Wherefore, the Apoſtle Eph. 4. ſaith, <hi>There is one</hi>
                  <note n="f" place="margin">Eph. 4, 5, 6.</note> 
                  <hi>baptiſme, one faith.</hi> Againe, Chriſt willed the Apoſtles to miniſter Baptiſme, not Baptiſmes. Laſtly, in baptiſme the death of Chriſt is repreſented, &amp; he dyed but once: ſo
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:21092:92"/> that as his death was not to be repeated, no more is bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme to be reiterated. Fourthly, the forme and manner of doing, is ſaid to be <hi>Into the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy-Ghoſt.</hi> Whereby is meant, that we haue fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowſhip with God in three perſons (as a wife hath with her husband, who paſſeth into her husbands name to be ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect to him, to obey him, to acknowledge and call vpon him, to worſhip no other God but the true <hi>Iehoua.</hi> This therefore is not to be vnderſtood onely of vſing the name of the Trinity in baptizing, but by it alſo is ment, that the perſons baptized are receiued into the grace &amp; fellowſhip of God, to become his people, and to bee partakers of his couenant to their ſpirituall comfort. Laſtly, in the deſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion before remembred, it is affirmed that the outward waſhing of the body, <hi>Repreſenteth the inward cleanſing of the ſoule by the blood of Ieſus Christ.</hi> This appeareth<note n="g" place="margin">Gal. 3, 27. Tit. 3, 5, 6. Rom. 6, 4.</note> expreſly, Gal. 3. <hi>All that are baptized into Christ, haue put on Chriſt.</hi> And <hi>Titus</hi> 3, 5, 6. <hi>According to his mercy he ſaued vs, by the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhing of the new birth, and the renewing of the Holy-Ghoſt, which he ſhed on vs aboundantly through Ieſus Chriſt our Sauiour.</hi> So alſo the ſame Apoſtle, <hi>We are buried with him by baptiſme into his death</hi> Theſe teſtimonies ou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> of the word of truth do e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uidently teach, that this is the principal ſcope and ende of baptiſme, to aſſure our conſciences by externall waſhing, of the inward clenſing of our ſoules by the blood of chriſt for remiſsion of ſins. This being the deſcriptio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of baptiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me, let vs ſee what good vſes may be made therof, &amp; euery part in order, as they haue bin laid before vs. And firſt tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching the<note n="h" place="margin">The vſe of the firſt part of the deſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> firſt point mentioned before in the deſcription, that Baptiſme is the firſt Sacrament.

So was the <hi>Eunuch</hi> when he was inſtructed: ſo was <hi>Paul</hi> when he was conuerted: ſo were the <hi>Iewes</hi> when they repented.

<pb n="154" facs="tcp:21092:93"/> firſt Sacrament of the new Teſtament? Then it followeth that he which is not baptiſed, is not to be admitted to the Lords table: he that hath not receiued the firſt Sacrament, is not to be made partaker of the ſecond. As in the old teſtament, circumciſion was the Sacrament of entrance &amp; admiſsion, and none was admitted to eate the Paſſeouer but ſuch as were circumciſed,<note n="l" place="margin">Exod. 12, 48</note> as wee ſee in Exod. 12. So none hath this right and priuiledge to come to the ſupper of the Lord vnleſſe firſt they be entred, and the doore o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened to them by baptiſme. For a man muſt be knowne to belong to our family and houſhold, before he preſume to eate of the childrens bread, that belongeth not to ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers.

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>here may be a waſhing without baptiſme, but there can be no baptiſme without waſhing. <hi>The</hi>

                  <hi>waſhing of water through the word.</hi> So that this waſhing is neceſſary, becauſe of the fit ſimilitude that is betweene it and our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generation or new-birth. The water is apt to cleanſe vs, and leaueth no filth behind: ſo is our iuſtification &amp; ſanc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification repreſented by the blood of Chriſt, as ſhall bee conſidered. Therefore ſuch as vſed ſand, or blood, or ſuch like matter not fit for waſhing, did not indeede bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tize, but horribly prophane the Sacrament of baptiſme. The third point in the deſcription is,<note n="o" place="margin">Vſes of the 3. part of the deſcription or Baptiſme.</note> that baptiſme is once onely to be adminiſtred, which affoordeth vnto vs theſe three vſes. Firſt, it ſheweth a difference betweene it and the Lords Supper. The apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaking of the Supper of the Lord, 1. Corinth. 11 ſaith,<note n="p" place="margin">1 Cor. 11, 16, 25, 23.</note> 
                  <hi>As oft as yee ſhall eate this bread and drinke of this cup:</hi> and Chriſt our Sauiour, <hi>Do this as oft as ye drinke it, in remembrance of me,</hi> therefore it muſt be often receiued of the Church. But baptiſme once miniſtred, is not againe to be repeated. As we are once onely borne into the world, but after our birth are daily nouriſhed: ſo we are but once baptized, but there is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual vſe of the Lords Supper, whereat we are fed to eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall life. Secondly, this teacheth that all rebaptizing is
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:21092:93"/> vnlawfull, as we ſee by the examples of the apoſtles,<note n="q" place="margin">Act. 2, 42, and 19, 1, 5.</note> who baptized not the beleeuers and members of the Church the ſecond time. For <hi>Acts</hi> 2. it is noted, that ſuch as belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued the Goſpell, continued in the apoſtles doctrine, in fellowſhip, in breaking of bread &amp; prayer: but not in bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizing againe or being baptized againe: and chap: 19, 4.5. the diſciples which were baptized, and had not receiued the gifts of the Holy-Ghoſt, <hi>Paul</hi> inſtructed further in the doctrine of Chriſt, and doth not rebaptiſe them but lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth his hands vpon them, and they receiue the viſible gifts of the Holy-Ghoſt. The reaſon is plaine againſt rebap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tization, becauſe it ſignifieth and ſealeth vp our once bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing borne againe, our once ſetting and ſetling into the body of Chriſt,<note n="r" place="margin">Ezek. 16, 8. Hoſ. 2, 19, 20.</note> and our ſpirituall marriage once with him, who is the ſpirituall husband of his Church. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by we ſee, that ſuch as haue been baptized<note n="ſ" place="margin">Such as haue beene baptized by heretickes, are not to be rebaptiſed.</note> by heretickes or other wicked Miniſters, are not to be rebaptized. It came in place of circumciſion: but none were twice cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſed, therefore none to be twice baptized. Againe, it is a Sacrament that repreſenteth our ſpirituall incorpora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion into the Church: but it is ſufficient once to be ingraf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and conſequently ſufficient to haue it once admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtred. This error of rebaptizing, aroſe vpon a corrupt vnderſtanding and interpretation of the place, <hi>Acts</hi> 19. <hi>When they heard it,</hi>
                  <note n="t" place="margin">Acts 19, 5.</note> 
                  <hi>they were baptized in the name of the Lord Ieſus.</hi> The difficulty of this place is taken away, if wee conſider they be the words of <hi>Paul</hi> continuing his ſpeech of <hi>Iohns</hi> baptiſme, not of <hi>Luke</hi> declaring what <hi>Paul</hi> did. But of this place we ſhall haue better and fitter occaſion to ſpeake further in the chapter following, where it is at large expou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded. Furthermore, if baptiſme be adminiſtred once for euer, it ſheweth that he which commeth to Chriſt once truely and indeed, ſhall neuer be caſt away;<note n="u" place="margin">Iohn 13, 1. Rom. 11, 29.</note> whom Chriſt Ieſus loueth once, he loueth for euer, becauſe his graces and guifes are without repentance. What ſhall ſeparate vs from Chriſt, when we are by his working adioyned vnto him?

<pb n="156" facs="tcp:21092:94"/> God, who hath made an euerlaſting couenant with vs, he ſhall neuer turne away from vs, to do vs good, we ſhall be his people, and he will be our God for euer. Indeed if we could cleane fall away from the grace of God, wee ſhould haue another regeneration, and another baptizing to bee the ſeale therof: but becauſe we are built vpon the brazen pillar of Gods election, the gates of hell ſhall not preuaile againſt vs; for this foundation remaineth ſure,<note n="a" place="margin">2.

Heere then is a great comfort ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led to all Chriſtians, in all tentations, againſt al the terrors and feares of conſcience, wherewith they are ready to be ſwallowed vp and ouerwhelmed. This muſt ſtrengthen and ſtay vs vp, that although we may fall greeuouſly, yet we ſhall not fall finally from the eſtate of grace. He that is once a ſound and liuely member of Chriſt, can neuer be wholy cut off. True it is, ſinne may leſſen our coniuncti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and weaken our communion with Chriſt: but if we be truely in him, the band ſhall neuer be diſſolued,<note n="c" place="margin">1 Ioh. 2, 19.</note> we ſhall neuer be wholy ſeuered and fall from him, as 1.

But it were moſt abſurd to ſay, wee ſhould be as often baptized as we fal into ſinne: and therefore howſoeuer Sathan may buffet, moleſt, tempt, and wound vs greeuouſly, yet hee can neuer ouer-maiſter vs wholy and ouercome vs finally,<note n="d" place="margin">1 Ioh. 3, 9.</note> as the Apoſtle declareth, 1 Ioh. 3. <hi>Whoſoeuer is borne of God committeth not ſinne, for his ſeed remaineth in h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Indeed euery Chriſtian that is fallen through infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitie, muſt riſe vp, repent vnfainedly, and ſhew forth the fruites thereof: yet the force and ſtrength of his baptiſme is not loſt, the fruite and comfort thereof remaineth for euer, and is extended as wel to the time to come as to the time that is paſt. So many therefore as affirme that the faithfull in their fals haue remedy in Penance, but no com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort by their baptiſme, do ſet vp themſelues, magnifying their owne dreames &amp; deuiſes aboue the holy ordinances of God. The 4. part of the former deſcription of baptiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me, is the forme of <hi>baptizing into the name of the Father, of the Son, &amp; of the Holy-Ghoſt.</hi>

               <p>HItherto wee haue ſhewed how baptiſme is taken and what it is. In baptiſme we are to conſider 2. things,<note n="a" place="margin">In baptiſme two things are to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered, his parts and his vſes.</note> his parts and his vſes. For in the former booke, when we ſpake of the Sacraments in generall, hauing ſhewed what a Sacrament is, we deſcended to his parts and vſes, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the perfect knowledge thereof conſiſteth: ſo we wil ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerue the ſame in handling the doctrine of the Sacraments in particular. The parts of baptiſme are firſt to be ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned: the vſes are to be reſerued to their proper place. The parts are two,<note n="b" place="margin">1 Pet. 3, 21. Mar. 1, 1 Act. 2, 38.</note> the outward and the inward parts. This appeareth, 1 Pet. 3. <hi>Whereof the baptiſme that now is, anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth that figure, which is not a putting away of the filth of the fleſh, but a confident demanding which a good conſcience maketh to God, and ſaueth vs by the reſurrection of Ieſus Chriſt.</hi> Where the Apoſtle teacheth, that ſinne cannot bee waſhed away by that outward water, but by Chriſts inward working,
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:21092:95"/> which the outward baptiſme doth ſhaddow. In like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner. <hi>Mar.</hi> 1. <hi>Truth it is, I haue baptized you with water, but hee will baptize you with the Holy-Ghoſt:</hi> where the Baptiſt ſheweth that hee baptized outwardly, but the force of it proceedeth from Chriſt who baptizeth inwardly. So Acts 2. <hi>Peter</hi> ſaid vnto them, <hi>Amend your liues, and bee baptized euery one of you in the name of Ieſus Chriſt for the remiſsion of ſinnes, and ye ſhall receiue the guift of the Holy-Ghoſt:</hi> Where the Apoſtle declareth, that in ſuch as repent and beleeue, the vertue of the Holy-Ghoſt is ioyned with outward baptiſme. Hence it is, that the Apoſtle writing to the <hi>Hebrewes</hi> Chap. 6.2, maketh mention of the doctrine of baptiſmes, ſpeaking in the plurall number, becauſe it hath two parts, the inward baptiſme of Chriſt, and the outward baptiſme of the Miniſter. The outward parts therefore are one thing, and the inward parts are another: that which is ſeene is one thing, and that which is vnderſtood is another thing.</p>
               <p>This diuiſion of the parts of Baptiſme, affoordeth di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers <label type="milestone">

And firſt of all, are there outward and inward parts of Baptiſme? Then we learne heereby, that the outwarde parts are no vaine ceremonies, no fruiteleſſe rites, no vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>profitable actions that may bee neglected or contemned, but auaileable ſignes, and effectuall ſeales of the ſprink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of Chriſts bloud for the forgiueneſſe of all our ſins.</p>
               <p>Againe, ſeeing there is ſuch an vnion of the parts be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene themſelues, we muſt not contemne, or deſpiſe, or deferre baptiſme. Wherefore the faithfull, all delaies, reaſons, and pretences ſet apart, haue ſpeedily prepared themſelues to do that which God commandeth. We haue a worthy example in <hi>Abraham,</hi>
                  <note n="c" place="margin">Gen. 17, 22.26.</note> when God required him to circumciſe himſelfe, his ſonne, and all the males of his houſe, and thereby to vncouer all their ſhames: hee doth not inquire why God required this at his hands, hee doth not complaine or conſult with fleſh and blood: ouer all doubts faith got the victory, and ſubdued reaſon vnder her, and cauſed him with diligence, readines, and expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion

Baptiſme belongeth not onely to the witneſſes and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties that bring the child, but to all the members of the Church, that we may learne by our preſence thereat, to renew our faith and repentance vnto God. Theſe men do too much diſgrace and deface the dignity of this Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament, not vouchſafing to remaine at the adminiſtrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on thereof, as if it were not worthy to bee ſolemnized before them: whereas they ſhould quicken their faith in the couenant of God, by beholding the works of the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter, and ratifying them in their hearts,<note n="t" place="margin">Luke. 1.58.</note> as we reade, <hi>Luke</hi> 1. where they are ſaid to circumciſe, becauſe they were all preſent at the worke, conſenting to prayers and thankſgiuings of the Church:<note n="u" place="margin">1 Cor. 11.5.</note> as alſo the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>Women pray and propheſie in the Church, when they ſit ſtill &amp; are partakers of the prayers and preaching vſed in the publike aſſemblies.</hi> And as no member is cut off by excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation,<note n="a" place="margin">1 Cor. 5.4.</note> but in preſence of all, to be witneſſes thereof &amp; to ratifie their griefe for the loſſe of a member of their body: ſo in<note n="b" place="margin">Reaſons ren<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>dred why the aſſembly ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine altogi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther vntill Baptiſme be finſhed.</note> Baptiſme it is required, to witneſſe and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proue the publike worke by their preſence, and to aſſure themſelues therby with ioy &amp; comfort, that a fellow-heir

Moreouer, the excellency of this Sacrament, is as great as of the other: they are of like woorthineſſe in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, and to bee had equally and indifferentlie in like price and eſtimation: they are both commanded and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted by the ſame authority of Chriſt: there is the ſame matter and ſubſtance of both, to wit, Chriſt with al his benefits: there is this one and the ſame end of both, the encreaſe and ſtrengthning of our faith: therfore why ſhould one Sacrament bee ſo much extolled aboue the other, and preferred before the other? So that whereas many come to the Lords Supper, few remaine and abide in the Church, at the adminiſtration of Baptiſme. Seeing then, as louing Siſters they goe hand in hand together, and are the deare daughters of one Father, what reaſon is there that one ſhould bee magnified, and the other diſgraced? The whole aſſembly heareth the worde preached and deliuered by the Miniſter: the Sacraments are Inſtruments of our Iuſtification by Faith,<note n="c" place="margin">Chriſt is af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter a ſort prea<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ched in bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme.</note> as well as the word preached, ſauing that the worde worketh by Hearing onely, the Sacraments ſerue by the ſenſes of Seeing, Handling, and Taſting as well as hearing; to ſtrengthen and encreaſe Faith in our hearts: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is requiſite that we ioyne in the one, as well as in the other.</p>
               <p>Furthermore, the excellency and worthineſſe of Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme appeareth herein, in that it was inſtituted of God ſealing vp his gracious couenant, in that it was ſanctified by Chriſt, being baptized of <hi>Iohn,</hi> and in that it was beu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified by the heauenly reuelation of the bleſſed Trinitie appearing thereat: ſo great honour, ſo great dignity &amp; preheminence was neuer giuen to any Ceremonie? Did God inſtitute it, and ſhall wee contemne it. Did Ieſus Chriſt come to <hi>Iohns</hi> baptiſme, and ſhall we diſdaine to be at the Baptiſme of Chriſt?

                  <hi>The Holy-Ghoſt was yet come downe vpon none of them, but they were onely bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed in the name of the Lord Ieſus: then laide they their hands on them, and they receiued the Holy-Ghost.</hi> Heere we are to obſerue this order, <hi>Phillip</hi> preached, the people belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, and were baptized: afterward the Apoſtles hands were impoſed, and ſo the Holy-Ghoſt is receiued.

                  <pb n="172" facs="tcp:21092:102"/> neither enquireth whether they were Baptized or no, ſeeing they were in the number of the Profeſſors of the faith, and beleeuers of the Goſpell (for they are called Diſciples) but whether they had receiued the giftes of the holy Ghoſt? Sixtly, if ſuch as haue beene once bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized were to be rebaptized, becauſe they are ſomtimes groſſely ignorant, and know not ſome neceſſary funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentall point of religion concerning the Trinity, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the offices or perſon of Chriſt, and ſuch like ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Principles: the apoſtles themſelues ſhould haue beene baptized againe, who conuerſing with Chriſt, hearing his Doctrine, ſeeing his Miracles, and knowing his behaui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, had yet taſted little of his ſpirituall &amp; heauenly king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,<note n="n" place="margin">Actes 1, 6.

The firſt is the Miniſter, as the Ambaſſadour of God ſent out by him with commiſſion to meddle in the matter of the Sacraments, as appeareth by the miniſtry of <hi>Iohn,</hi> by the commandement of Chriſt, and by the examples of the Apoſtles.

For his meaning is not ſimply to relate and ſet downe his office whereunto hee was called, but by conferring it with his preaching: as if hee ſhould ſay, This is not the chiefe and principall end of my calling and function to baptize; the high work of my miniſtery is to preach the Goſpell. Indeede they are both of them parts of the Miniſters Office, but this is the chiefeſt to labour in the word and doctrine, in regard of the greater gifts requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, and of the fruite that floweth and followeth from thence to their hearers, it being the high ordinance of God to ſaue ſuch as belieue.</p>

               <p>Firſt, baptiſme is a part of the miniſtry, which none may vndertake but ſuch as are therunto lawfully called. God hath ioyned the<note n="g" place="margin">Mat. 28, 19. Heb. 5, 4. Mat. 19, 6.</note> miniſtry of the word and Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments together: and what God hath coupled together, let no man ſeparate, Mat. 19.6. But women or priuate perſons may not be admitted to teach in the publike aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblies<note n="h" place="margin">1 Cor. 14, 34, 35.</note> in a true and well ordered Church, 1 Cor. 14. <hi>Let your women keepe ſilence in the Churches, for it is not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted vnto them to ſpeake, but they ought to bee ſubiect, as alſo the Law ſaith: and if they will learne any thing, let them aske their husbands at home, for it is a ſhame for women to ſpeake in the Church.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 Tim. 2, 11, 12.</note> And 1 Tim. 2 <hi>Let your women learne in ſilence with all ſubiection, I permit not a woman to teach, neither to vſurpe authority ouer the man, but to bee in ſilence.</hi> Likewiſe,<note n="i" place="margin">Reuel. 20, 20.</note> the Apoſtle reproueth the Church of <hi>Thya<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tira,</hi> that it ſuffered a Woman to teach among them, and to exerciſe the publike miniſtry of the word, contrary to Gods commandement and the practiſe of Gods peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.

               <p>The cauſes hereof are direct and euident. For to teach publikely, is a token of authority and rule ouer others, inaſmuch as the teacher is higher in place and authority then hee that is taught, as <hi>Paul</hi> was brought vp at the feete of<note n="l" place="margin">Act. 22, 3.</note> 
                  <hi>Gamaliell,</hi> and as the leſſe is bleſſed of<note n="m" place="margin">Heb. 7, 7.</note> the greater. Therefore, the woman ſhould not be admitted
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:21092:104"/> to be a maiſter in <hi>Iſraell,</hi> a teacher of the Church, and an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructer of men, as 1 Tim. 2. where the Apoſtle forbiddeth them to teach publikely, and to vſurpe authority ouer the man, but requireth of them to be in ſubiection, not to chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge dominion. Againe, ſuch is the<note n="n" place="margin">1 Pet. 3, 7. Eccl. 7, 29, 30.</note> frailenes and weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of that ſexe, that they are eaſier to be ſeduced and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued, and ſo fitter to be authors of much miſchiefe being the weaker veſſels: therefore <hi>Paul</hi> hauing ſet downe the doctrine that women ſhould not take vpon them to teach in the Church, and ſo preach in the aſſembly of men, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently alledgeth this reaſon,<note n="o" place="margin">1 Tim. 2, 13 14. Gen. 3.6.</note> that <hi>The woman was firſt decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued of the diuell, and was in the tranſgreſsion:</hi> hee made choiſe of her, and made her an inſtrument to beguile her huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band.</p>
               <p>For albeit that women be capable of the doctrine of god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe, and many examples of learned women are extant euery where, and in euery nation (which might eaſily bee produced) and that ſuch were of ability ſufficient to teach the Church, yet ſhamfaſtneſſe and modeſty (the ſpeciall or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naments of that ſexe) do not ſuffer them to enterprize and execute that function, which requireth courage and bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe in the diſcharge thereof. True it is, among the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles in their ſacrifices and ſolemnities were women-Prieſts (fit Prieſts for ſuch purpoſes, fit Miniſters for ſuch Gods) but in the Church of God, neither vnder the law, nor vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Goſpell, were they allowed to ſerue at the Altar, or to offer the ſacrifice, or to meddle with the ſeruice of holy things: and therefore it is vnlawfull to haue a womaniſh Miniſtry. And as <hi>Moſes</hi> teacheth in the booke of Deu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teronomy,<note place="margin">Deut. 22, 5.</note> that it is <hi>an abhomination for a man to put on wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans apparell,</hi> ſo it is not onely vnſeemely and vndecent, but vnlawfull &amp; vngodly for a woman to put on that bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and manlineſſe which appeareth in the countenance of a man, and to put off the baſhfulneſſe and demureneſſe which ſhee ought to carry with her. <hi>Salomon</hi> in the deſcription of a vertuous woman among other laudable properties as partes of her office obſerueth, that ſhee

It is neuer noted as the part of a good woman, that ſhe ſtretchech out her hand to water, and baptizeth the children that are in danger. Let her meddle in matters of another nature; ſhe hath nothing to do to handle theſe holy things. True it is, the gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the family vnder her husband is committed, and the training vp of her children in the feare of God,<note place="margin">

So then, to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit the office of the miniſtry to women, or any part of it, were as much as to turne the nature of things topſie turny, and to bury and aboliſh the ordinance of God. For hee that ſhould be beneath, is ſeated aboue: and he that ſhold be in ſubiection is indued with ſoueraignty and authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. The keyes of the kingdome of heauen are commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to men, not to women: if then they enter into the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uices of the Church, they do it by a wrong key, and are no better then intruders.</p>
               <p>Furthermore, the Miniſter repreſenteth Gods perſon in this holy worke, and therefore he onely can offer and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuer with power and authority the outward ſigne, which anſwereth fitly to the inward matter. Shall priuate per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons vſurpe to be the Lords meſſengers, to bring his let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters and ſeales, not called, not allowed, not authorized? It cannot be without intruding of themſelues, and diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour to God, and confuſion in the Church. For as none can waſh vs from our ſinnes but Chriſt onely: ſo none can beare his perſon in the outward Sacrament of the inward waſhing, but hee whom Chriſt himſelfe hath appointed, if we will receiue the benefit of the holy ſeale of baptiſme, for the aſſurance of our conſcience<note n="p" place="margin">The people cannot with comfort aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue a Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment at the hands of pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uate perſons.</note> that wee are waſhed from our ſinnes.

               <p>Againe, there is a difference betweene circumciſion and baptiſme. For this falling out before the law, was more lawfull, when circumciſion was left more at liberty: yea vnder the law there was no ſpeciall commandement giuen to the Prieſts to circumciſe, which ſhould tye it vnto the Prieſt-hood onely. But Chriſt in the Goſpell hath appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the ſame perſons to be Preachers of the Goſpell &amp; Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters of the Sacraments.

I anſwer, the Apoſtles bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized indeed by the miniſtery of others, but the Scripture doth not teach that thoſe others were Lay-men, and ſuch as had no office or function in the Church.

<pb n="183" facs="tcp:21092:107"/> ſoeuer they went, as appeareth in ſundry places of the <hi>Acts.</hi> And if as yet there were no Paſtors and Teachers ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed in the Church, nor ordinary Miniſters erected, it pertaineth not to the queſtion in hand, becauſe when wee enquire what perſons are permitted to miniſter the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, wee vnderſtande it of the ordinary and ſetled go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernment of the church: whereas that may not be ſuffered in a Church planted, which is allowed in the beginning while it is planting, and the foundation is in laying before an ordinary miniſtery be erected. Againe, thoſe that did baptize at the appointment of <hi>Peter,</hi> did it not of their own head, but by the warrant of the Apoſtle, who may be ſayd to baptize by their hand, becauſe he that dooth a thing by other, may bee ſayde to doe it himſelfe, as it is ſayde ſometimes that Chriſt baptized, Iohn 3, 22.<note place="margin">Iohn 3.22.</note>

               <p>Theſe things may ſeeme contrary the one vnto the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, Ieſus baptized, Ieſus baptized not: yet the latter place openeth and expoundeth the former, and ſheweth; that if wee ſpeake touching his practiſe in his owne per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, hee baptized not; but if wee ſpeake what hee did by the hand, and by the Miniſtery of his Diſciples, hee baptized; becauſe when hee had preached, hee ſealed his Doctrine by Baptiſme, which the Apoſtles mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtred.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, there is nothing which I knowe, to hinder, why theſe wordes thus written, <hi>Peter commaunded them to bee baptized,</hi> may not bee thus interpreted, He com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded Water to bee brought, where-with they ſhould bee baptized: as ſuch as attend and ſerue the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtour, in carrying about the Breade, or reaching the Cup, ſhould bee ſaid to miniſter the Lords Supper. For the aſsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant may beare the name of doing the chiefe &amp; principall

But howſoeuer it was, they are greatly, I will not ſay groſſely deceiued, that imagine the Apoſtle would not vouchſafe to do it, ſo long as other wer preſent that might do it. For this ſhould ſauour of Antichriſtian pride, which was farre from the Apoſtles, who bare themſelues with all Chriſtian humility, as they had learned of their Lord and Maiſter: beſides the miniſtry of the holy Sacraments is of the ſame nature with the preaching of the word, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore is of greater worth and excellencie, then any mortall man liuing vpon the face of the earth, is woorthy to han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle.</p>

He therefore that will ground any thing vpon this authority, and practiſe ſuch Lay-baptiſme from this place, muſt do it with a doubtfull conſcience, which in him that doth it is ſinne, albeit it were in it ſelfe lawfull. Again,
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:21092:108"/> if this godly Father ſtand in doubt whether baptiſme mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtred by a lay-man be auaileable, or no; and conſequent-whether ſuch perſons ſo baptized ought to be rebaptized, it is manifeſt that hee alloweth not that a lay-man ſhould take vpon him to baptize; for if he had holden ſuch mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration to bee lawfull, there had beene no cauſe or reaſon why he ſhold doubt, whether that baptiſme were good or not.</p>
               <p>Let not any therefore ground vpon his authoritie more then euer he taught them: but rather let vs ſtom hence in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre, that ſeeing hee was not reſolued whether baptiſme by a lay-man be auailable, doubtleſſe he was out of doubt, that being adminiſtred through the preſumptuous intru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of a woman, it is voide and of no effect, who is doubly barred from publicke charges of the Church, more then a priuate man. Furthermore, wee anſwere, that the iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of this learned and reuerend Father, is in this cauſe leſſe to be waighed and eſteemed, and indeede not at al to be allowed and followed, becauſe he aſcribeth too much to baptiſme and the outward waſhing with water, as thogh all they that departed hence without it, were damned for euer. And this is that which made him ruſh vpon the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer rocke, ready to ſuffer ſhipwracke: for rather then hee would haue the infant periſh, hee would haue any meanes vſed that were poſsible, to ſaue the ſoule of the child: but we know that God is not ſo hard to them, who hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed to be their God, nor the ſentence of his word ſo hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uy, foraſmuch as the children of the faithfull are within the Couenant, and called holye by the Apoſtle: of which wee ſhall ſpeak at large afterward. <hi>Victor Vticenſis</hi> in his ſecond booke of the perſecution of the <hi>

The women came to the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulcher to ſee Chriſt, therefore we muſt go on pilgrimage to viſite the holy Sepulcher. But I will paſſe ouer theſe fooleries, and come to the place that is obiected.

<pb n="189" facs="tcp:21092:110"/> betweene male and female, Iew and Grecian, bond and free: but there is great difference betweene man and man in the diſpenſation of the word and Sacraments. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, if this concluſion were neceſſary, then a man might reaſon againſt the Apoſtle, <hi>In Chriſt is neither Male nor Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>male;</hi> therefore, as well women as men may teach in the Church, contrary to the expreſſe doctrine of the Scripture, ſet downe by <hi>Paul</hi> himſelfe, <hi>I permit not a woman to speake in the Church,</hi> 1 Cor. 14. 1 Tim. 2. But I will ſpend no moe words in anſwering ſuch trifles. Thus much concerning the obiections.</p>
               <p>Now, as the truth is plaine and euident: ſo the vſe is <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Vſe </seg>1</label> profitable and comfortable. Firſt, if the miniſter be one out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward part of baptiſme, then he muſt be ready and carefull to performe his duty, which is, to waſh the vncleane body with water in the name of the Father, of the Sonne, and of the holy Ghoſt; to call vpon God, and to follow the inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution of Chriſt, as it is left in the Scripture for his directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. For if there be the outward ſign of baptiſme as the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the Sacrament, if there be a party to bee baptized, which is the receiuer; and if there be a miniſter to admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter it: yet vnleſſe he perform his duty, there can be no bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme. So then we muſt know that the actions of the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter<note n="i" place="margin">What are the actions of the Miniſter.</note> are double: firſt there is required of him a ſanctifying of the water: ſecondly, a waſhing of the party. The ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying of the water, is the ſeparation and apointing of it by the word and prayer to this vſe, to ſignifie the bloude of Chriſt. The outward waſhing is a certain pledge vnto vs of our inward waſhing by the blood and ſpirit of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Secondly, if it bee the office of the Miniſter to baptize, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Vſe </seg>2</label> then this giueth direction and inſtruction to the people, to whom to repaire and reſort, when they haue any Children to be baptized. It is required of them to haue recourſe to the miniſters, as to the officers of God. We ſee in the affairs of the Common-wealth, and in paſsing conueyances of houſes, of lands, and of inheritances, how carefull and cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſpect men are, to paſſe them where they ought to bee paſſed, and in ſuch Courts, and vnder ſuch officers as are au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorized
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:21092:111"/> for ſuch purpoſe, that ther may be no error com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted in the conueyance. For whatſoeuer is done and paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed before him that hath not his patent to warrant his pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe, is held to be voide and fruſtrate by maiſters of that profeſsion. In like manner it ſtandeth vs all vpon, when a matter of an higher nature and of greater importance is in hand, then the ſealing and aſſuring of temporall poſſeſsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, to looke carefully to the diligent performance of this ſpeciall duty, that the ſigning of our infants, and ſealing them in the Couenant, be made by the hands of ſuch Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers as are appointed by God for that purpoſe, and by no other.</p>
               <p> 
                  <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Vſe </seg>3</label> Thirdly, this condemneth the abuſe and prophanation of the Sacrament of baptiſme in the church of <hi>Rome,</hi> where women, midwiues, and priuate perſons, without any com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement of God, nay contrary to his word, take vpon them this part of the Miniſters office to baptize children; which they haue receyued from the Hereticke <hi>Marcion,</hi>

                  </note> teacheth, the holy Mother of Chriſt was not permitted to do. And the fourth Councell of <hi>Carthage,</hi> Can. 100. hath without exception decreed, that a woman ought not to baptize. Such then as vſurpe this calling, and approoue thereof, neuer knewe the force of our adoption in Chriſt, nor the ſtrength of the couenant, nor that the elect are ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued by the good pleaſure and will of God. Therfore, there is not that abſolute neceſsity of baptiſme vnto ſaluation, which many ſuppoſe, that for this ſuppoſed neceſsitie, the ordinance of God ſhould be broken and prophaned. And a man may maruell, why at ſuch times they did not rather commit the matter to priuate men to baptize then to wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men (whoſe ſexe is further remooued from execution of this office) not onely becauſe they be vncalled and priuate men,<note n="l" place="margin">1 Tim. 2, 11, 12. 1 Cor. 14, 34.</note> but euen becauſe they are women, and thereby are wholly vncapeable (though otherwiſe qualified) of anie publike charge or function in the Church, they are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded to ſit ſtill, and to bee quiet. Beſides, if in time of this extreamity and neceſsity which is imagined, it be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:21092:111"/> them to miniſter baptiſme, why ſhould it not bee ſuffered in like neceſſity and danger of death, that they mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter the Lords Supper, and preach the Goſpell, (in caſe they be able, and men vnable or vnwilling) the dignitie of the one Sacrament being no leſſe then the other, &amp; the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellencie of the worde, being as great as of them both? If then women may iuſtly bee condemned, when they ſhall preſume to ſit downe in the Chaire of <hi>Moſes,</hi> or to miniſter the Supper of the Lord, they cannot be iuſtified, if they v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurpe to miniſter baptiſme. For, ſhall wee make a ſhame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and double diuorcement of thoſe things that God hath coupled, betweene the word and Sacraments, and likewiſe betweene the one Sacrament and the other? This <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>s too great contumely and contempt offered to baptiſme, to al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low it in thoſe that may neither publikely preach, nor law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully miniſter the Lords Supper: ſeeing their want to pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe the one, is no greater then to do the other.</p>
               <p>In a priuate Family, it is a great diſorder to ſee the mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter play the ſeruant, and the ſeruant to do the office of the maiſter: the husband to looſe his authority, and the Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man to ſtep into his place. In the Common-wealth it is a wonderful confuſion to ſee baſe perſons and peaſants ſet on horſebacke,<note place="margin">Eccl. 10, 6, 7.</note> and Princes walking as ſeruants vpon the ground. Is this vnſeemely and vncomely in the priuate houſe, and in the Common-welth, and it is not as vndecent in the Church, when the diſtinct partes of the ſame office, are diuided and parted aſunder, that priuate perſons are ſet in <hi>Moſes</hi> his chaire, and paſtors are put at the feete of the people? Or when the Miniſters of the word do occupy the place of Tea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>hers, and the adminiſtration of the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments is committed, or at leſt permitted to the Pariſhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oners and people, and which is worſe, to Women? And when different offices are ſo ſhuffled and ſhaken together, that it cannot be determined to whom of right they do be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long? Wherefore, let all priuate perſons and Mid wiues conſider with themſelues the fearefull examples recorded in the Scripture, of ſuch as haue raſhly p eſumed to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane the holy offices of the Church, and how God hath
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:21092:112"/> often viſited this great ſinne with greeuous iudgementes, ſometimes with fire from heauen, ſometimes the earth ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning her mouth ſometimes with ſodaine death, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times with the moſt filthy diſeaſe of the Leproſie, whereby as by his voice from heauen, he thundred downe on mens diſobedience, and ſo ratifieth this law of the neceſsity of a vocation &amp; calling for euer. When the men of <hi>Bethſhemeſh</hi> pried into the Arke without a calling, the Lord ſmote of the people fifty thouſand, threeſcore and ten men. 1 Sam. 6, 19.<note n="m" place="margin">Numb. 16, 9 Pſ. 106, 17, 18</note> 
                  <hi>Corah, Dathan,</hi> and <hi>Abiram,</hi> taking vpon them the Prieſthood without a calling, fire from heauen came down conſuming <hi>Corah</hi> and his conſortes: the earth alſo opened and ſwallowed vp <hi>Dathan,</hi> and couered the companie of <hi>Abiram,</hi> that they were ſwallowed vp aliue: none of them died the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon viſitation of other men, but God wrought a ſtrange worke vpon them, and altered the courſe of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, which ought to be a perpetuall inſtruction and direc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion vnto vs, to teach vs not to peruert or euert that order which he hath eſtabliſhed to continue in his Church. Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto belongeth that which is written of <hi>Vzzah,</hi>
                  <note n="n" place="margin">2 Sam. 6, 7.</note> who was ſmitten with ſodaine and vnexpected death, onely for that beyond the boundes of his calling, he put foorth his hand to vphold the Arke, which did ſhake and was readie to fall, which was lawfull for the Leuites onely to meddle withall, althogh his intent &amp; purpoſe were neuer ſo good: ſo that if the vnlawfull intruders vpon baptiſme pretende caſes of neceſsity, heere ſeemed as great a neceſsity, yea his minde and meaning was as good as theirs; if they pretend deuotion, yet it diſpleaſed God becauſe it was done with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out his word and warrant. So <hi>Azariah</hi> was ſtriken with le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proſie, that he was a Leaper to the day of his death, for that not being content with his Kingly<note n="o" place="margin">2 Kings 15, 5</note> office, hee would take vppon him the prieſtes office to burne Incenſe vnto the Lord.</p>
               <p>Theſe woorthy examples of Gods moſt ſeuere iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments executed vpon the breakers of this ordinance ought to ſtrike ſuch a feare into our hearts, that we ſuffer not the ſacred functions and offices of the Church to bee propha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:21092:112"/> and to teach vs that euery one meddle onely with the approued duties of his owne calling. And although God doth not now thus execute iudgement from heauen, and worke ſtrange things in the earth in extraordinary maner, when his ordinances are broken: yet the ſinne is not there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by leſſened, nor the puniſhment mitigated, nor the hand of God ſhortened, but ſtretched out ſtill, though iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment according to deſert bee deferred: nay rather the<note n="p" place="margin">Nah. 1, 2. Eccl. 8, 11.12.13.</note> greater wrath is reſerued for his aduerſaries, to the great day of account, when all fleſh ſhall appeare before the throne of his glorious preſence. For if the prophaners of the ſigne and Sacraments of the old Teſtament did not eſcape, but were thus ſharply and ſeuerely puniſhed: our Sacraments eſtabliſhed by the Lord Ieſus are not of leſſe value and worthineſſe, ſo that the contempt of them ſhall be viſited with ſorer iudgements.</p>
               <p>And if God did ſtrike with his reuenging hand priuate men when they ſinned in abuſing the Sacraments, and ſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red not kings in the pride of their hearts: how ſhould wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men ſtanding a degree farther off, and barred from the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice by a ſtronger bolt, enter into the houſe<note n="q" place="margin">Ioh. 10, 10.</note> at a window, and not be accounted as theeues and robbers? So that we conclude, that the neceſsity of a calling is as great as the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſsity of baptiſme. And thus much of the firſt outward part of baptiſme, namely the Miniſter.</p>

                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Vſe </seg>1</label> Now the vſes remaine to be conſidered. Firſt, hereby it is manifeſt, what a ſolemne couenant and contract, &amp; what a neere coniunction is made by the waſhing in baptiſme betweene God and the perſons baptized: for God the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther vouchſafeth to receiue them as his children into fauor, the Sonne to redeeme them, the Holy-Ghoſt to purifie and preſerue them, to comfort and regenerate them, to protect and defend them from al euill. This is the ſtaffe and ſtay of our hope and comfort.</p>
               <p>Now to be baptized in the name, or into the name of the Trinity is all one, and therefore in the Scripture they are vſed indifferently, without difference or diſtinction. They are ſaid to be baptized in the name of Chriſt, Acts 2.38. and Chapter 10.48. they are ſaide to be baptized into the name of Chriſt, Mathew 28. <hi>Acts</hi> 8.16. and 19, 3, 4, 5. The comfort which we receiue from hence, ſtandeth vpon the right vnderſtanding of theſe words. To be baptized in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the name of the Father, is to haue aſſurance giuen vnto vs that God the Father through Chriſt our Lord is become our Father, and that therefore wee ſtand bound to performe the duty of obedient children toward him. To bee baptiſed in the name of the Sonne is to haue aſſurance giuen, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing baptiſed we are in the number of them that are redeemed by him and reconciled to the Father through his blood, and therefore ſtand bound to obey him as our mediator and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer. To bee baptiſed into the name of the Holy-Ghoſt, is to haue aſſurance giuen, that euery true beleeuer is ſealed vp and ſanctified by the Holy-Ghoſt againſt the day of his full redemption.</p>
               <pb n="195" facs="tcp:21092:113"/>
               <p>Now, we can haue no greater comfort then this, to bee aſſured that GOD the Father, is become our Father, that GOD the Sonne is become our Redeemer, and that GOD the holye Ghoſt, is become our Sanctify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er.</p>
               <p>Secondly, conſider on the other ſide, that the parties thus <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Vſe </seg>2</label> baptized do promiſe and vow, to acknowledge, beleeue, ſerue, worſhip, and call vpon the name of no other Gods, but of the true God, which is the Father, the Sonne, and the holy Ghoſt; and conſequently to renounce the workes of the deuill, the faſhions of the world, and the luſtes of the fleſh. Baptiſme is as it were a ſolemne oath taken in the ſight of God, and in the face of the congregation, whereby the perſon baptized, bindeth himſelf wholly to God, three in perſons, but one in ſubſtance. Indeed we deſerue to be caſt out of the fauour and family of God, yet hee vouchſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feth to entertaine vs, to receiue vs, and to acknowledge vs for his children; therefore wee muſt in euery eſtate depend vpon him, honour him as our God, ſerue him as our Mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, obey him as our Lorde, and looke for ſaluation from him as from our redeemer. Againe, as we haue beene bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized, not in the name of one perſon alone, not in the name of the Father alone, or of the Sonne alone, or of the holie Ghoſt alone, but in the name of the Father, and of the Son and of the holy Ghoſt, ſo we muſt all beleeue and confeſſe as an article of our faith, that the Trinitie in vnity, and vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in Trinitie is to bee worſhipped, For, albeit there are three reckoned vp as ſpeaking of many: yet heere is alſo mentioned their name, as ſpeaking onely of one, not of their names, baptize them in the name of the three perſons. So many as deny the doctrine of the Trinity, are iuſtly to be condemned of falſhood and hereſie. Such is the Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Iewes, Greekes, Turks, Perſians, and in ſome ſort the Papiſtes, albeit in wordes theſe laſt acknowledge one God in three perſons. The Greeke Church at this day, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nieth in effect the God-head of the holy Ghoſt, inaſmuch as it holdeth him to proceede from the Father onely. The Turks and Iewes do vtterly deny the deity both of the
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:21092:114"/> Sonne and of the Holy-Ghoſt: the preſent Church of <hi>Rome</hi> more glorious in ſhew, but not much more ſound in faith, hath defiled the whole Trinity with their Imagerie, and ſet vp a falſe Chriſt, partly denying him to bee GOD of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, and partly repealing all his offices: ſo that howſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer they profeſſe him in words, and leaue him the name of a Sauiour: yet they m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Wherefore as we are baptized into the moſt worthy name of the bleſſed Trinity, let vs hold faſt the true profeſsion thereof, and renounce al errors and hereſies oppugning our holy faith, and depriuing vs of the ſweet comfort we haue therein.</p>

Againe, it cannot be deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, but that the Apoſtles<note n="e" place="margin">Act. 10, 47. and 15, 2.</note> baptized in this forme, in the name of the Father, and of the Sonne, and of the Holy-Ghoſt, as <hi>Acts</hi> 10, ver. 47. <hi>Can any forbid water that theſe ſhould not be baptized, which haue receiued the holy-Ghoſt as wel as we?</hi> As if he ſhould ſay, theſe haue receiued the guifts of the Holy-Ghoſt, therfore they may be baptized in the name
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:21092:114"/> of the Holy-Ghoſt. And more plainely <hi>Act.</hi> 19. when the Diſciples had anſwered <hi>Paul</hi> that they knew not whether there were an Holy-Ghoſt, he ſaith, <hi>Vnto what were yee then baptized?</hi> Whereby he ſheweth, it was the manner and cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome to baptize in the name of the Holy-Ghoſt, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently of the whole Trinity. The <hi>Euangeliſts</hi> alſo teach, that at the baptiſme of <hi>Iohn,</hi> the Father, Sonne and Holy-Ghoſt were preſent. And as he baptized with the ſame matter, why ſhould we imagine hee obſerued not the ſame forme that Chriſt commanded expreſly to his Apoſtles? Nay, ſeeing in the baptiſme of <hi>Iohn</hi> we haue proued there was the ſame promiſe, the ſame grace, the ſame vertue, the ſame ſigne, the ſame ſignification, which was in the bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme of the Apoſtles (as we haue proued before) why ſhold we only doubt of the words of inſtitution? Or why ſhould we imagine that the forme ſhould be altered and changed? Wherefore we conclude, that the Apoſtles would not alter any thing of the direct and expreſſe words of their Lord &amp; Maiſter,<note n="f" place="margin">Mat. 28.19.</note> preſcribed Math. 28. where he chargeth them both what to preach and how to baptize. For as he enioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth them to teach the Nations to obſerue whatſoeuer he commanded them: ſo he willeth them to baptize in the name of the Father, of the Sonne, and of the Holy-Ghoſt. And as they altered nothing in the matter of teaching: no more did they in the maner of baptizing, conſidering that as the doctrine they preached was the doctrine of God; ſo the Sacraments they deliuered were the Sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts of God, and they had no more leaue in the one, then liberty in the other. If then any ſhould baptize otherwiſe then in the name of the Trinity, or ſhould name the Sonne to be vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>equall to the Father, or ſhould deny the proceeding of the Holy-Ghoſt, or ſhould baptize in the name of the Virgin <hi>Mary</hi> and the Saints, this cannot be the Sacrament of Baptiſme inſtituted by Chriſt, but a ceremony made void and fruſtrate by our owne inuentions.</p>

Theſe men (as if it were a baſe and contemptible thing to baptize with water onely, according to Chriſts commandement) haue brought in a new word &amp; new elements, that is, new droſſe and new filth into the Church, and into the Sacraments of the Church: as ſalt, that we may be ſeaſoned with wiſedome, and bee kept from putrifying in ſinne: oyle, that we may bee ſafe from euill ſuggeſtion: ſpittle, that our eares may be ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to heare the word, &amp; our Noſtrils to diſcerne the ſmel of good and euill: croſſes, that all our ſences may bee de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended againſt the euill ſpirit,</p>

None were vſed when Chriſt was baptized, neither gaue he any ſuch thing in charge to

Thus in one Sacrament they find many Sacraments, and inuent types, ſhaddowes, ſimilitudes and ſignifications in the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate ſeruice of God, whereas we haue the body it ſelfe, that is, Chriſt already. They make theſe outward things able to giue grace, power, and ſtrength againſt the Diuell. But the Apoſtle teacheth, that the weapons of our warfare are not carnall,<note n="m" place="margin">2 Cor. 10, 4 Eph. 6, 12.</note> they are ſpirituall, that muſt defend vs from euill.

Whereas the comlineſſe and dignity of the Sacraments is to be eſteemed by the word of God, by the inſtitution of Chriſt, by the ſimplicity of the Goſpell, and by the practiſe of the Apoſtles, Nothing is more comly, decent, and orderly, then that which Chriſt commandeth and alloweth; nothing is more vncomely or vnſeemely, then that which man inuenteth in the ſeruice of God, and in the celebration of the Sacraments, thereby inuerting &amp; peruerting the holy ordinances of God.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, if waſhing with water bee an outward part of <label type="milestone">

And if the ſaluation of the child did depend vpon the outward Sacrament, it had beene an hard thing in the Lord (who will<note n="p" place="margin">Ezek. 18, 23</note> not the death of a ſinner) to haue requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the deferring of it one weeke, one day, one houre, one minute?

But if hee had thought all condemned that dye vncircumciſed, his lamentation would haue exceeded, for he had cauſe to haue ſobbed and ſorrowed more after his death, then he did in the childes ſickneſſe: and if circumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion had beene of ſuch abſolute neceſsity, hee might haue ſaide, The childe being now dead, why ſhould I not faſt? why ſhould I not weepe? why ſhould I not afflict my ſoule? ſeeing I cannot bring him againe, or reſtore him to life to be circumciſed? But becauſe he ſorrowed not as one with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out hope, and he complained not on this or any like manner: it appeareth that his faith apprehended the ſaluation of the childe, and feared not his damnation through vntimely want of the outward Sacrament.</p>
               <p>Now, God is not ſtreighter and harder to vs vnder the Goſpell, then he was to the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> vnder the law: he is no leſſe able and willing to ſaue now without baptiſme, then in thoſe dayes he was without c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="208" facs="tcp:21092:120"/> is not tyed and glued to the outward water. The neglect of the Sacrament is a notable marke of a deſpiſer, and therefore the Phariſies are ſaide to haue <hi>reiected the counſell of God againſt themſelues, beeing not baptized of him. Luke</hi> 7, 30. It is ſtrange to conſider, what childiſh excuſes and pretences parents vſe to iuſtifie their neglige<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming this good duty to their Children. For baptiſme is neceſſary in reſpect of God that hath commanded it; in reſpect of the Church, the lawfull vſe of it being a note of the true Church: and in reſpect of the promiſe annexed vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to it.

For wee haue ſhewed before, that the Sacraments without their vſe are no Sacraments. And albeit the worde ioyned to the ſigne make a Sacrament, yet this preſuppoſeth a Miniſter to adminiſter it, and a receiuer to take it: and then the rule is moſt certainely to bee ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted. Now whether the whole body ſhould be waſhed, or a part of the body: whether it ſhould be waſhed once, or oftner: whether it ſhould be dipped, or ſprinkled: we are neither curiouſly to enquire, nor ſeriouſly to contend, nor raſhly to determine: but reſt in practiſe of the Church, and in the cuſtome of the country, as in a thing in it owne nature indifferent. The dipping and plunging into the water vſed by <hi>Iohn Baptiſt,</hi> and the Apoſtles in <hi>Iudea</hi> and ſuch hot regions, are not a neceſſary rule to be drawne in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to imitation, eſpecially in theſe colde quarters and coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries.</p>
               <p>For the word doth not onely ſignifie to diue, to put and plunge into the water, but to dip, to ſprinkle, and to waſh. This ſprinkling doth very fitly anſwere to the ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nification of water. For the apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> teacheth that we are <hi>elect according to the foreknowledge of God the Father, through the ſanctification of the Spirit vnto, obedience &amp; ſprink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of the blood of Ieſus Chriſt,</hi> as 1.

They then are much deceiued, that would bring in an abſolute neceſsity of dipping Children into the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, as if without it they were not lawfully baptized. For as we noted before, the word importeth euen ſimply any waſhing of what ſort ſoeuer, as Marke 7.

For euill ſpirits which fight againſt the ſoule are not driuen away by hallowing of belles. If then, there were euer prophanation of Baptiſme, this may iuſtly bee iudged to be one of the moſt vile and miſerable corruptions ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, to bee deteſted of all true hearted Chriſtians that grone vnder the burthen of them. For this is a generall and cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine rule, that none are to be baptized but ſuch as are men, to other creatures the Sacrament of baptiſme may not bee
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:21092:123"/> adminiſtred: foraſmuch as the Sacrament of regeneration belongeth to none but to ſuch as in their nature are capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of regeneration, neither the ſigne but to thoſe that may be partakers of the thing ſignified. Baptiſme is the Sacrament <hi>of repentance,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Mark. 1, 4.</note> none therefore can receiue it but ſuch as in time may repent, or already haue repented, for there muſt bee at leaſt a poſsibility of repenting. It be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longeth not therefore to the damned ſpirits, who are ſo fallen away, that it is impoſsible for them to be renued a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine by repentance. It was inſtituted onely for the vſe of man, for whom alſo Chriſt came into the world, and ſhed his blood vpon the Croſſe. Hee tooke not vpon him the angels nature, but the ſeed of <hi>Abraham,</hi> Heb. 2.<note place="margin">Heb. 2, 16.</note> He is the Mediator to his Father, not for the apoſtate angels, but for mankinde, 1 Tim. 2.<note place="margin">1 Tim. 2, 5.</note> How wicked then and wretched are they that make a mocke of this Sacrament repreſenting the blood of Chriſt, and vndertake to baptize belles without ſenſe and life, and that with greater pompe and ſolemnity, and vſe many moe ceremonies then when men are bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed? For none may of right baptize belles but their By<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops (a fit worke for ſuch workemen) whereas they allow and licenſe not onely euery inferior Prieſt, but euen wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men to baptize their children. Secondly,<note place="margin">The ſecond abuſe.</note> it reprooueth the ſuperſtition of ſuch as baptize the dead, or any one that is liuing in ſtead or in place of another that is dead. For this is another rule to be holden of vs, that baptiſme be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longeth onely to the liuing. Not indeed to all liuing creatures, but onely to liuing creatures: as likewiſe not to all that are reaſonable, howbeit onely to them that are reaſonable. Faith and repentance are required of al ſuch as being of yeares are baptized: but the dead can neither beleeue the Goſpell, nor repent from dead works. And if baptiſme be the Sacrament of regeneration, and the ende thereof ſaluation and remiſsion of ſins, what do theſe, or what can theſe things belong vnto the dead? Againe, it is the greateſt folly that may be, to baptize one for another, becauſe Chriſt neuer requireth, and the Scripture neuer teacheth, that one ſhould repent for another, or beleeue
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:21092:124"/> for another, or bee baptized for another, but euery one muſt repent, and beleeue, and be baptized for himſelfe; and therefore the Lord ſaith, Mar. 16, 16.<note place="margin">Mar. 16, 16.</note> 
                  <hi>Hee that beleeueth and is baptized ſhall be ſaued.</hi> Wee can no more be bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fited by another mans baptiſme, while we remaine vnbap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized our ſelues, then we can bee ſaued by another mans faith, while we remaine Infidels.

Now hee that lyeth vnder the bed anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth that he deſireth it, and then they baptize him for the other that is dead. Whenſoeuer they are accuſed for this folly, they go about to defend themſelues by the place of the Apoſtle, 1.

                  <hi>If the dead riſe not at all, why are they then baptized for the dead?</hi> This te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony maketh nothing to their purpoſe, which prooueth the reſurrection from the dead. For whether <hi>Paul</hi> reaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth from the cuſtome of the <hi>Iewes</hi> that waſhed the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies of the dead, as appeareth in the <hi>Acts</hi> of the Apoſtles, Chapter 9,<note place="margin">Act. 9, 37</note> verſe 37. when <hi>Tabithae</hi> a woman full of good workes and almes-deeds was dead, <hi>They waſhed her, and laid her in an vpper Chamber:</hi> or whether he meane it of the greeuous afflictions which the faithfull ſuffered for the Goſpels ſake vnto death: as if he had ſaid, Why do we ſuffer aduerſity vnto death?

<pb n="217" facs="tcp:21092:124"/> the firſt chapter of this booke. Wherefore to conclude this point, it is no doctrine nor determination of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle, either that dead men ſhould be b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  <hi>They that gladly receiued his worde were baptized.</hi> And Chriſt our Sauiour ſaith in the firſt place, <hi>Hee that beleeueth,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Mar. 16, 16.</note> and then addeth in the ſecond, <hi>and is baptized.</hi> So that both faith and repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance are required in all thoſe of yeares that are to bee baptized. And the reaſon is euident, becauſe without repentance the olde man is not put off, and without faith the newe man is not put on. Now the Sacrament of Baptiſme is a Sacrament of regeneratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> through the blood of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Wherefore, to admit ſuch as are vnbeleeuers and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>repentant ſinners, what is it but euen to tread vnder foote the blood of Chriſt, and to make a mocke of the new Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament? This barreth out very ſtrongly from this pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiledge of the Church all Turkes, Iewes, Infidels, and all ſauage nations whatſoeuer, that haue not the knowledge of true religion, but remaine in blindneſſe and igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of Ieſus Chriſt and his Goſpell: and on the other ſide it teacheth, that baptiſme is by no meanes to bee de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyed vnto them which make profeſsion of faith and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance. Heere before wee do proceede any further, we will anſwere a few queſtions that may bee demanded touching diuers perſons, whether they may bee bap<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ized or not.</p>
               <pb n="218" facs="tcp:21092:125"/>
               <p>The firſt queſtion ſhall be, whether the infants of <hi>Turkes, Iewes,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Whether the Children of <hi>Iewes</hi> &amp; <hi>Turks</hi> may be bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed.</note> and ſuch like barbarous nations may be baptized? I anſwere, that eyther their parents or ſuch are in ſtead of parents giue conſent to haue them baptized, or they will not giue their conſent. If they will not agree that their children ſhould be baptized, they ought not to be bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed againſt the liking and good will of their parents: but if they be content and deſirous, they may be admitted and receiued vnto Baptiſme. This determining of the queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on holdeth touching infants, and infants onely. For all ſuch as are of full age and are come to yeares of diſcretion to deſire baptiſme, may not nor ought not to depend vpon the conſent of parents, but whether they be willing or vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing, they muſt beleeue in Chriſt, profeſſe the faith, prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe repentance, and deſire to be entred into the Church, ſaying with the conuerted Eunuch,<note place="margin">Acts 8.36.</note> 
                  <hi>Act.</hi> 8. <hi>See, heere is wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, what hinders me to be baptized? And Philip ſaid, If thou beleeueſt with all thine heart, thou maieſt.</hi> For euery man ſhould follow Chriſt his maiſter, albeit his parents ſhould diſſwade him, or forbid him. Howbeit for infants the caſe is otherwiſe, they are vnder the iurisdiction of their parents, and they rule ouer them, ſo that they cannot with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out wrong and iniuſtice be taken from them, to whom by the law of nature they do properly belong. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Chriſt commanded not the widdowes ſonne whom he raiſed from the dead to follow him,<note place="margin">Luk. 7, 15.</note> but deliuered him to his mother: neither could he be compelled to follow him againſt the good will of his mother, for that had beene to abrogate and aboliſh the authority of the parents ouer their children. But if they can be perſwaded, and will be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented to haue them baptized, then they haue no wrong at all done vnto them, for iniury cannot be offered to them that are willing. Such fathers giue ſome hope that in time themſelues wil profeſſe the faith: &amp; in this caſe the Church is as a tender mother ouer ſuch infants, and therefore may iuſtly and rightly baptize them. Thus much touching their children that are out of the boſome of the Church. The next queſtion is touching the children of thoſe which
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:21092:125"/> indeed liue within the doores of the Church, but yet are prophane and vngodly, who are in the Church,<note place="margin">Whether the children of prophane and impenitent perſons may be baptized.</note> but not of the Church: whether they may be baptized or not? I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere, if the infants of ſuch impenitent perſons be brought and offered to be baptized, they cannot nor ought not to be barred and excluded from it. For albeit their parents be wicked men, and vnworthy of any grace or priuiledge of the Church eyther for themſelues or their poſterity, yet it is no reaſon that their impiety ſhould any way hurt or hinder the ſaluation of their Children that are borne in the Church, or ſhut them from the meanes of furthering their ſaluation. Heereunto commeth the ſaying of the Prophet <hi>Ezekiell, The ſoule that ſinneth ſhall dye:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ezek. 18, 20.</note>

                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Anſwere. </seg>
                  </label> firſt that in this point we are not to regard the vngodlineſſe of ſuch as are their naturall pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents of whom they were begotten, but the godlineſſe of the Church in which and of whom they were borne: for the Church is as it were their mother. Secondly, we muſt conſider, not onely their immediate parents, but their fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fathers and anceſtors which haue led a godly and holy life: So that albeit they be the children of vnfaithfull parents in reſpect of the Fathers of whom they came in the fleſh, yet they are not the children of ſuch, if we regard the ancient Fathers and the Church wherein they were borne, which is their mother. To this purpoſe <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>If the firſt fruites be holy, the lumpe is alſo holy: and if the roote be holy,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Rom. 11, 16.</note> 
                  <hi>ſo are the branches,</hi> Rom. 11. By the name of <hi>root</hi> in that nation of the <hi>Iewes,</hi> he doth not vnderſtand the next parents who perad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenture were prophane &amp; vngodly, but thoſe firſt parents of that people, to wit, <hi>Abraham, Iſaac, and Iacob,</hi> to whom the promiſe was made and the couenant confirmed, that God would be their God and the God of their ſeed by an euerlaſting couenant, and therfore al their poſterity which did not wholy forſake and renounce the true God of <hi>Iſrael,</hi>
                  <pb n="220" facs="tcp:21092:126"/> and cleaue to the falſe Gods of the Gentiles (which are no Gods but the workes of mens hands) are within the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſe of the couenant, and rightly iudged to be holy in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of the holineſſe of the couenant. Among Gods owne people the <hi>Iewes,</hi> we know that many were wicked perſons, yet was not circumciſion the ſigne of the couenant euer de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyed to their children: In like manner the Sacrament of Baptiſme may not be taken away from the childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of ſuch as are counterfeit Chriſtians which profeſſe Chriſt in words, but deny him in their deeds, foraſmuch as euen they are in the Couenant in regard of the Elders of whom they deſcend, and in regard of the whole Church in which they are borne and do liue.<note place="margin">Whether children born in adultery may be bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed.</note> This point being duely waighed and conſidered, ſerueth to anſwere another queſtion, to wit, whether children borne in fornication and adultery may be baptized? I anſwere, as ſuch were circumciſed in the Church of the <hi>Iewes,</hi> ſo they may bee baptized and ought to be baptized in the Churches of the Chriſtians. And as the children of wicked Chriſtians, who hold true religion in iudgement, but deny it in their practiſe, are to be partakers of baptiſme, as we haue already prooued in the former queſtion: ſo may the children of the adulterer and of the whore, prouided that there be ſome to anſwere and to vndertake for them beſides their parents. For it skil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth not what the next parents were, out of whoſe loynes immediately they proceede, neither is it materiall in this caſe, whether the parents doe repent or not, foraſmuch as their children being preſented by other then the parents themſelues and brought vnto baptiſme, may not be reiect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from the Church. It pleaſeth God in mercy to call ſome of them to beleeue, and to bring them to ſaluation, as we ſee in the example of <hi>Iepthah,</hi> who was the <hi>ſonne of an harlot</hi> and borne in fornication,<note place="margin">Iudg. 11, 1. Heb. 11 32.</note> yet he is commended in the Epiſtle to the <hi>Hebrewes,</hi> and regiſtred among the cloud of faithfull witneſſes, who through faith wrought righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, out of weakneſſe was made ſtrong, waxed valiant in fight, and turned to flight the armies of the <hi>Aliens,</hi> Heb. 11.34. So then, albeit the children of harlots beare the brand
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:21092:126"/> of their parents ſhame, and are oftentimes giuen ouer to follow the ſinne of their parents, yet if they hate their wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked waies, God hath grace in ſtore for them.

                  <hi>Ezek.</hi> 18 The next queſtion to be diſcuſſed and decided, is, whether the children of Recuſants and profeſſed Papiſts haue right to be baptized or not? I anſwere two things; firſt that their parents are ſuch as were baptized in the name of the Father, and of the Sonne, and of the Holy-Ghoſt, and they haue receiued true baptiſme, albeit corrupted with ſundry ſuperſtitions. Secondly, albeit the papacy be not the true Church, yet the true Church is in the papacy, and to be ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered out of it, and for this cauſe baptiſme yet remaineth in the eſſentiall part of it: ſo that ſuch children as are bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized in the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> ought not to be rebaptized, becauſe the true forme of baptiſme is obſerued; and like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe their children may be baptized in our Churches, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uided that their parents deſire this baptiſme, or conſent vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to it, as we noted before in diſputing about the baptizing of the children of <hi>Turks</hi> &amp; Infidels: and againe, there be ſuch ſureties as wil vndertake the education and training vp of the child in the true knowledge of God, and faith in Chriſt Ieſus.</p>
               <p>The laſt queſtion which now I wil ſtand vpon is,<note place="margin">Whether the children of excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate perſons may be bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized.</note> whether the children of excommunicate perſons, which are caſt out of the Church, and not holde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as members of it, may be bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized or not? I anſwere, they cannot nor ought not to be kept from partaking of baptiſme. For firſt touching the parents that are excommunicate, it lyeth not in the power
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:21092:127"/> of the Church to cut them off from the body of Chriſt: for albeit they be ſeparated fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Church for ſome greeuous offence,<note place="margin">Beza epiſt. <hi>10.</hi>
                  </note> yet they are not open apoſtataes &amp; backſliders that combine themſelues with the enemies of the Church, and ſeeke the ruine of the Church, and plot the ouerthrow of the Goſpell. Albeit for a ſeaſon they bee put out of the viſible Church, it is not to their deſtruction, but their conuerſion: and in the iudgement of charity we muſt hold them to be as decayed members, which are as plants engraf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted into Chriſt, albeit for the preſent time they haue not any liuely and ſenſible feeling of the power of Chriſts Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite in them. They are as an arme that hath a dead palſie, which though for a while it remaine without ſenſe, ſo that the body hath no vſe of it, nor benefit by it: yet by the ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of ſome ſtrong medicine it may bee recouered and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtored to the former ſtrength, and ſo made as whole and ſound as the other. A free-man belonging to any incor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poration, that is impriſoned for ſome crime, remaineth a free-man ſtill, although for the time he be reſtrained, and haue loſt the vſe of his liberty. Againe, parents are ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed out of the Church for their owne perſonall ſinnes: but it is againſt the light of reaſon &amp; common equity that the perſonall ſinnes of the father ſhould interrupt and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercept the bleſsing of God from the Childe; for then the prouerbe ſhould be true, that <hi>the fathers haue eaten ſowre grapes,</hi>

                  <hi>CHAP. VII.</hi> That Infants are to be baptized.</head>
               <p>ALthough it cannot appeare vnto vs, that infants and new borne babes brought to be baptized, haue actual faith, but rather is like they want the habite of faith which
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:21092:128"/> hue<note n="a" place="margin">Deut. 1, 39.

               <p>Firſt therefore, we will proue by euident demonſtration out of the Scriptures, the doctrine of childrens baptiſme to be conformable to the <hi>Iewes</hi> circumciſion, agreeable to the practiſe of the Apoſtles, allowable by the words of Chriſt, anſwerable to the cuſtome of the primitiue Church, reaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable in it ſelfe, profitable to the infants, auaileable by the ordinance of God, and very comfortable to all Chriſtian parents. Secondly, we will maintaine this aſſertion a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the obiections and arguments of the <hi>Anabaptiſts</hi> and other aduerſaries, that haue croſſed and contradicted this truth. Laſtly, we will ſhew what euident and neceſſary vſes may be gathered from hence, for the ſtrength of faith, and the increaſe of our obedience.</p>
               <p>Touching the firſt, that the baptizing of infants is war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranted by the word<note n="b" place="margin">Reaſons warranting the baptizing of children.</note> of God, I wil make it appeare by ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry reaſons. Wee ſee in the olde Teſtament, that all males by expreſſe commandement were willed to bee cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſed the<note n="c" place="margin">Gen. 17, 12. Phil. 3, 5.</note> eight day. If God made infants parta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers of circumciſion: why ſhould we not hold the ſame of baptiſme, being inſtituted for vs in ſtead of circumciſion,<note n="d" place="margin">Col. 2, 11.</note> there being the ſame promiſes in both, and there being the ſame ends of both? If then the couenant made with <hi>Abraham</hi> remaine ſtable and ſtedfaſt, it doth no leſſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to the children of Chriſtians at this day, then it did appertaine to the children of the <hi>Iewes</hi> vnder the old Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament: vnleſſe peraduenture we will ſay, that our Sauiour Chriſt by his comming hath reſtrained or diminiſhed the grace and loue of his Father, which were deteſtable blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemy againſt the Father, and an horrible reproch againſt the Sonne of God. From hence then, we reaſon thus: If the infants of the <hi>Iewes</hi> were circumciſed, then the children of Chriſtians are to be baptized: but the infants of the <hi>Iews</hi> were circumciſed: therefore alſo the children of Chriſtians are to be baptized.</p>
               <pb n="226" facs="tcp:21092:129"/>
               <p>Againſt this reaſon, ſundry exceptions are taken by the aduerſaries of this doctrine, <label type="milestone">

                  </label> which are not vnworthy the conſideration. They ſay, circumciſion was a ſigne of morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, it was tyed to be adminiſtred the eight day, and that women ought not to be baptized, if baptiſme were like to circumciſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, inaſmuch as they were not circumciſed. I anſwere, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Anſwere. </seg>
                  </label> theſe obiections wil eaſily appeare to be very ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uils and meere dreames of idle and addle braines, if we dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently obſerue, both wherein circumciſion and baptiſme agree, and in what points they differ. They<note n="e" place="margin">Wherin cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion &amp; baptiſme a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree.</note> agree, firſt, in one author of them both, that is, God himſelfe, who firſt appointed the Miniſter of circumciſion, which was <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi> and <hi>Iohn</hi> the Miniſter of baptiſme, whereof hee was called the Baptiſt. Secondly, in the chiefe and principall ends for which they were inſtituted, namely, to ſeale vp the promiſes of grace by Chriſt. Thirdly, by both of them is wrought our viſible receiuing into the Church: the <hi>Iewes</hi> were receiued by circumciſion, the Chriſtians are entred by baptiſme. Laſtly, by both of them our mortification, rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration, newneſſe of life, and iuſtification are ſignified. So then they fully agree in the ends which they reſpect, and in the things which they ſignifie, to wit, in the ſubſtance and nature of the things themſelues. The ſame Chriſt is promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in circumciſion, and giuen in baptiſme.</p>
               <p>Againe, circumciſion and baptiſme differ<note n="f" place="margin">Wherin cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion &amp; baptiſme dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer.</note> onely in cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine circumſtances: firſt, in the forme and manner of doo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, as circumciſion was adminiſtred by cutting away of the foreskin &amp; effuſion of blood, but baptiſme by waſhing and ſprinkling with water. Secondly, in the outward ſigne, which is indifferent in both. Thirdly, in the circumſtance of time: for circumciſion promiſed from God grace and mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy in the <hi>Meſſias</hi> to come, baptiſme in the <hi>Meſſias</hi> already exhibited. Fourthly, in the ſubiects or perſons that are par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers of them: circumciſion belongeth onely to the male children, but baptiſme is common to male and female. Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding,<note n="g" place="margin">How wome<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> were after a ſort circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed.</note> howſoeuer the bodies of the men children alone were imprinted, yet through them the women were after a ſort made partakers and companions of circumciſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:21092:129"/> ſo that albeit God commanded onely the males to haue this ſigne in their fleſh, yet the females were not excluded from being members of the Church, nor accounted ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers from the Couenants of promiſe. For as the man is the<note n="h" place="margin">1 Cor. 11, 8.</note> head of the woman, ſo they were accounted as circumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in the man, yea they were reckoned and numbred with the men, namely, the vnmarried with their father, and the married with their husbands. Now that their circumciſion was thus comprehended in the men, ſo that it was vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in ſtead of circumciſion to be borne of the circumciſed, may be gathered by many places, as Luk. 13. Where the woman which Chriſt healed of a ſpirit of infirmity bound together, is called<note n="i" place="margin">Luk. 13, 11.</note> the daughter of <hi>Abraham,</hi> to ſignifie that the priuiledge of his poſterity belonged no leſſe to her and all women that were faithfull, then to the males; and that ſhe was as well his daughter, as they his ſonnes. Likewiſe <hi>Gen.</hi> 34. the ſonnes of <hi>Iacob</hi> communing with <hi>Hamor</hi> after their ſiſter was humbled and abuſed, ſaid vnto them,<note n="k" place="margin">Gen. 34, 14.15, 16.</note> 
                  <hi>We cannot do this thing, to giue our ſiſter to an vncircumciſed man, for that were a reproofe vnto vs: but in this we will conſent vnto you, if ye will be as we are, that euery man-ch<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Fiftly, they differ in the ſetled time which is limited for circumciſion, being preciſely and neceſſarily tied to the 8. day: but in baptiſme it is not ſo, there is greater liberty left to the church: yet the Sabboth following would not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out vrgent cauſe be omitted. Sixtly, circumciſion was inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted for the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> that were the ſeed of <hi>Abraham:</hi> but Baptiſme was inſtituted for all Nations that are willing to ioyne themſelues to the fellowſhippe of the Churches of Chriſt that profeſſe his name, of whatſoeuer Land and lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage they be. Laſtly, circumciſion was to endure onely till the comming of the <hi>Meſſias,</hi> but the body being come, the figure muſt ceaſe, whereas baptiſme is to continue vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:21092:130"/> the end of the world<note n="l" place="margin">Mat. 28, 20.</note> as our Sauiour teacheth, Mat. 28. <hi>Teach and baptize, and loe I am with you vntill the end of the world.</hi> Wherefore, the circumciſion of the <hi>Turkes</hi> and <hi>Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tars</hi> which liue in infidelity, and of the <hi>Moores</hi> which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe chriſtianity vſed at this day, is nothing worth, albeit they retaine the outward ſigne and ceremony: becauſe the inſtitution of it was only to endure vntill the bleſſed times of the Goſpell. Thus we ſee, that notwithſtanding the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences betweene circumciſion and baptiſme in circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of time &amp; manner of doing: yet being in ſubſtance and effect the ſame, the argument ſtandeth ſtrong and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uincible as a brazen wall, prouing the baptizing of infants in the time of the Goſpell, from the commandement of cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſing infants in the time of the Law.</p>
               <p>Againe,<note n="m" place="margin">The prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe of the Apoſtles.</note> let vs conſider the practiſe of the Apoſtles and ages ſucceeding in this point. For albeit it be not expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, that any infant was baptized by the hands of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles: yet we finde in diuers places, that whole families and houſholds haue beene baptized, in which no doubt were many infants &amp; ſucklings,<note n="n" place="margin">Act. 16, 13.33. 1 Cor. 1, 14, 16.

They know not what is done: they perceiue no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing what the Lord of the Manour or ſtewarde ſpeaketh vnto them: yet we ſee among the wiſeſt men in this world, this is not thought fooliſh, neither is ſuch an admiſsion
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:21092:132"/> called into queſtion, but they are afterward inſtructed what they haue done, what they haue vndertaken &amp; taken vpon them, what ſeruices and duties they owe, what their Lord requireth of them, and how they hold their lands.</p>
               <p>Thus they are admitted in their infancy to a temporall inheritance and poſſeſsion: this they hold to the ende of their life: and of the validity of ſuch entrance no tenant maketh doubt. Why then ſhould it ſeeme vnreaſonable to giue them baptiſme, the ſigne of the couenant, beeing borne heires of the promiſe, that after they come to diſcre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion they may make vſe of it as the reſt of the members of the Church? They ſhall vnderſtand afterward that which they vnderſtand not for the preſent: &amp; yet if it pleaſe God to take them in mercy to himſelfe from the miſeries of the world, before they know the myſtery of their baptiſme, he worketh extraordinarily by waies beſt knowne to himſelfe the force of their baptiſme in their hearts, and ſealeth vp their engrafting into Chriſt Ieſus. If then children haue the white wand deliuered vnto them to aſſure them of the inheritance which they hold: let none deny vnto them the partaking of this Sacrament, whereby they are aſſured of an eternal inheritance howſoeuer for the preſent time they are not capable of the knowledge thereof.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, the priuiledges and prerogatiues of children are no leſſe then thoſe of elder yeares. For infants are a part of the Church of God,<note n="t" place="margin">Children are Chriſts ſheepe and members of his body.</note> they are the ſheepe of Chriſt, they are the children of the heauenly Father, they are inheritors of the kingdome of heauen, they are redeemed with the blood of Chriſt, and engrafted into his body: why then ſhould they not beare the marke of Chriſt, ſeeing they are a principall part of his poſſeſsion? If they be a part of the houſhold, they ought to haue entrance into the houſe: if they belong to the Citty of God, who ſhall dare to ſhut the gates againſt them? Or if they bee in the number of the ſheepe of Chriſt, who ſhal preſume to keepe them from the ſheepefold? Or if they be ſound members of the body of Chriſt, who ſhall cut them off as rotten members? Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore then,<note n="u" place="margin">Gen. 17, 7. Acts 2, 39. 1. Cor 7, 14.</note> ſhould they not receiue the ſeale whereby the
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:21092:133"/> promiſe is confirmed vnto them, ſeeing they haue the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe it ſelfe of ſaluation? Why ſhould they not bee parta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers of the outward ſigne,<note n="a" place="margin">Mat. 19, 14.</note> ſeeing they are partakers of the thing ſignified? Why ſhould they be put backe from the fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure, ſeeing they haue the truth it ſelfe? Why ſhould they not be partakers of the Sacrament with the faithfull, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing they are enrolled in the fellowſhip of the faithfull? And who ſhall depriue them of the ſeale of the couenant, ſeeing they are partakers of regeneration and remiſsion of ſinnes?</p>
               <p>Heereupon thus we reaſon, whoſoeuer are in the coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant and Church of God, vnto them belongeth baptiſme, which is the ſeale of the couenant: but Infants are in the Couenant and of the Church: therefore to them belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth baptiſme which is the ſeale of the Couenant. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, to whome the promiſe appertaineth, they may and ought to bee baptized: but the promiſe was made euen to Infants: therefore they may and ought to be bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized.</p>
               <p>Furthermore, to whom forgiueneſſe of ſinnes and the Holy-Ghoſt are promiſed and giuen, they ought by no meanes to be denied the outward ſigne: but forgiueneſſe of ſinnes and the Holy-Ghoſt are promiſed to Infants and giuen vnto them: therefore infants ought not to be kept from the element of water, no more then ſuch as are of yeares of diſcretion. Thus much of the firſt point, put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting Children into the right and poſſeſsion of Baptiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me, as if it were the right heires into their inheritance, from which they haue beene wrongfully and vniuſtly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſeſſed.</p>

                  </label> vnblameable examples &amp; practiſes not contradicted, are in the nature of precepts. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, the will of God approuing and appointing childrens baptiſme appeareth,<note n="c" place="margin">Col. 2, 11.12</note> in that it came in place of circumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, <hi>Baptiſme is our circumciſion.</hi> Beſides, we<note n="d" place="margin">Mat. 28, 19. 1 Cor. 10, 1, 2.</note> haue a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall commandement, <hi>Go teach all nations and baptize them.</hi> And the apoſtle ſaith, <hi>all were baptized in the cloud and in the ſea:</hi> and he comprehendeth the whole Church, when hee ſaith, it was clenſed with the waſhing of water, Epheſians 5. verſe 26.

               <p>Secondly, they obiect, if infants may be baptized, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Obiection. </seg>

                  </label> there is not the like reaſon and reſpect of both. There is great difference betweene theſe two Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. For baptiſme is a ſigne of our entrance and receiuing into the church, ſo that the Supper is to be granted to none but to ſuch as are baptized, and are fit to be<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     <desc>•••</desc>
                  </gap>ſh vs by the body and blood of Chriſt. Wherfore, the Lord Ieſus to ſhew that his Supper was not for children but for men, would not admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter it in the element of milke, which is for infants and for new borne babes: but in bread and wine, which are for ſtrong men that are of age.</p>
               <p>Againe, ſundry conditions and conſiderations are requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in the ſupper which debar yong infants, that although they are to be baptized, yet they ought not to be admitted
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:21092:134"/> to the Lords ſupper, ſeeing by their young yeares they are excluded. For it is required of all thoſe that come to this ſupper,<note n="e" place="margin">1 Cor. 11.26 28, 29.</note> to ſhew foorth the Lords death, to diſcerne the body and blood of Chriſt, and try themſelues whether they haue faith and repentance. But infants cannot doe theſe things, they cannot ſhew forth the Lords death, they are not apt to diſcerne his body and blood, they are not able to examine themſelues, and therefore infants for good cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes are excluded from this Supper.</p>
               <p>If any ſay, Is this a good reaſon, the promiſe doth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to infants, and therefore the Sacrament of Baptiſme? Then why may not the Lords Supper be as well giuen vnto them vpon the ſame ground? This will not follow how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer ſome of the ancient Fathers were of that opinion,<note place="margin">Cyprian Ser. <hi>5.</hi> de lapſ. Auguſt. de eccl. dogm. cap. <hi>52.

They were therefore decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued that thought the Supper of the Lord did belong to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants. And touching this conſequence, The promiſe of grace belongeth to children, Therefore the outward ſigne of the Sacrament: it is true being rightly vnderſtood, to wit, according to the limitation, and the appointment of God, proper to euery Sacrament, who hath ordained that the Sacrament of entrance ſhould be receiued both of men and children,<note place="margin">Gen. 17.</note> howbeit only the males in the old Teſtament and not before the eight day: but in the new Teſtament both of male and female without reſtraint of time. And touching the Supper of the Lord, which is the Sacrament of our noriſhment, it can appertaine to thoſe onely that are come to yeares of diſcretion, firſt, becauſe the end thereof is <hi>to ſhew the Lords death vntill he come.</hi>

But infants are not capable of doctrine, neither do they actually beleeue: therefore they are not to be baptized.

But he intreateth in this place of ſuch as are growne vp, which muſt firſt haue knowledge in the Goſpell, faith in Chriſt, and repentance from dead workes before they be baptized: but infants are baptized by reaſon of the promiſe made to their parents. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouer, we might oppoſe vnto theſe the example of circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion, which we know, and they are not ignorant was gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen to infants, who could not yet beleeue: ſo that ſuch as barre them from baptiſme, becauſe they are not capable of faith and repentance, might in like manner exclude the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants of the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> from circumciſion. Baptiſme is the Sacrament of repentance and faith, though neither of theſe be in infancy, yet they are baptized to the repentance and faith to come, which albeit they be not actually formed in them, yet by the fruites afterward they ſhall appeare to be in them.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, if baptiſme ſhould be giuen onely to thoſe that truely beleeue, it ſhould likewiſe be denied to ſuch as are of vnderſtanding; for wee are not able to pronounce of theſe that they do truely beleeue, and certainly apprehend the promiſes of the Goſpell. Wherefore, if infants are not to be baptized, becauſe they haue not faith and want repentance: neither are they of ſufficient age to be bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed, of whom it cannot be directly and vndoubtedly ſaide, they do beleeue. <hi>S mon</hi> the ſorcerer mentioned<note n="l" place="margin">Act. 8, 13, 20.</note> in the <hi>Acts</hi> of the Apoſtles was baptized, and yet remained an hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrite.

Againe, Chriſt ſtood not in need to be baptized in reſpect of himſelfe, being without origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:21092:136"/> or actuall ſinne to be waſhed away, and therefore <hi>Iohn</hi> at the firſt put him backe:<note n="r" place="margin">Mat. 3, 15.</note> yet he would bee baptized for our ſakes, to fulfill all righteouſneſſe, to ſanctifie our bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme in himſelfe, and that thereby we might know he was inſtalled into his office. But we ſtand in need to be bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed, to ſeale vp the waſhing away of our ſinnes, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore there is great difference in this reſpect between Chriſt and vs. Beſides, the Euangeliſt doth teſtifie, that albeit our Sauiour were baptized at thirty yeares of age, yet hee was circumciſed at eight daies old. Now we haue proo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued before, that the ſame which circumciſion was to the <hi>Iewes,</hi> baptiſme is to all Chriſtians. If then he in his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fancy were circumciſed, then children in their infancy may be baptized, and are not commanded to waite thirty years: for baptiſme is our circumciſion, as the Apoſtle teacheth: but Chriſt in his infancy was circumciſed,<note n="ſ" place="margin">Luk. 2, 21.</note> when the eight dayes were accompliſhed: therefore children in their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fancy may be baptized.</p>
               <p>Furthermore, baptiſme was not hitherto as yet in vſe, it was not commanded to be vſed when he was a childe, and therefore he could not poſsibly be baptized, vnleſſe we wil imagine he might be baptized, before baptiſme was. So that we ſee, as he would not haue his circumciſion deferred one day beyond the time appointed: ſo hee was preſently baptized, ſo ſoone as baptiſme was inſtituted of God, and adminiſtred by <hi>Iohn.</hi> Fiftly, we are no more tyed to this circumſtance of time in Chriſts baptiſme, then we are to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther circumſtances of time, place, and perſons in the Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per: he miniſtred it in an vpper Chamber, and before his paſsion: we in Churches, before dinner, and after his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection. Laſtly, when the time appointed came, that the promiſed Sauiour and redeeme of mankinde ſhould manifeſt himſelfe to the world, then he ſhewed himſelfe o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penly, then he came to the preaching and baptiſme of <hi>Iohn,</hi> and began to publiſh the glad tidings of ſaluation,<note n="t" place="margin">Mar. 1, 15.</note> and to exhort men to repent and beleeue the Goſpell.

               <p>Now as we haue ſeene the truth proued by the Scripture, and maintained it againſt all the ignorant cauils of the <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nabaptiſts</hi> and other <hi>Arrians</hi> of <hi>Tranſiluania,</hi> that haue<note n="u" place="margin">Miniſtri.

                  </note> that teach that the baptiſme of children is by tradition, not by diuine inſtitution, from their word vnwritten, not in the word of God written. But we haue confuted the <hi>Anabaptiſts</hi> by the Scriptures, and conuinced them by the inſtitution of circumciſion, by the tenor of the couenant, by the holines of their birth, by their redemption through the blood of Chriſt, and by the practiſe of the Apoſtles. This is better armour, theſe are ſtronger weapons, this is a ſharper ſword to cut in ſunder the corrupt hereſie of the <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nabaptiſts,</hi> then the wooden dagger of humane tradition which the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> draweth out againſt them. The Scripture is all-ſufficient<note n="b" place="margin">2 Tim. 3, 16.</note> to proue all truth, and to beate downe all falſe doctrine that lifteth vp it ſelfe againſt God. Wherefore, we hold their traditions to be ſuperſtitions: and their vnwritten verities are written lies. As we retaine the baptiſme of children, ſo we haue alwayes bin ready to maintaine it by the old and new teſtament, as by the ſword of the Spirit againſt all the aduerſaries thereof.</p>

               <p>So likewiſe the Church oftentimes lyeth vnder the croſſe, and is ſubiect to perſecution, as<note n="c" place="margin">Reuel. 11, 6.</note> the woman driuen into the Wilderneſſe, Reuelations 12, 6. and ſo the bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme of many members might many times be doubted off and called into queſtion, (foraſmuch as no impreſsion a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bideth in the fleſh, as there did in circumciſion) the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches haue thought it ſit and conuenient to require certaine men to be as ſpeciall witneſſes of infants their bringing to Chriſt and to the Church by baptiſme, and of their names giuen them in their baptiſme.</p>
               <p>True it is, there is no expreſſe commandement in the Scripture, neither is it a thing in it ſelfe neceſſary to haue choſen witneſſes, which they call God-fathers, to vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take for the child. Neuertheleſſe, it is commendable, and not raſhly to be reiected and refuſed: For firſt, it is not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the Scriptures, and the doctrine contained therein. Secondly, it hath bin a very ancient cuſtome in the Church, which ſeemeth to haue ſprung from the baptiſme of thoſe that were called <hi>Catechumeni,</hi> being as it were nouices and newly taught in the principles of chriſtian religion. Theſe being asked concerning their faith, did not onely make anſwere themſelues, but gaue witneſſes &amp; ſureties of their faith: in imitation of whom it is now extended generally to the baptiſme of euery one, euen of infants. Thirdly, it containeth and commandeth nothing vniuſt, or vnho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt, or vnlawfull, or any way inconuenient. Fourthly, it proceedeth from charity, both of the fathers which chuſe ſuch God-fathers to bee an helpe vnto them in bringing vp their children, and of ſuch alſo as promiſe for them, and in their name. Laſt of all, it tendeth vnto the good of the childe and of the whole Church. Of the Childe, when beſide the parents (who may depart out of
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:21092:140"/> this life and leaue their children young,) there are others as guardians and aſsiſtants to haue an eye ouer them, who ſhould not ceaſe to call vpon them to learne true religion, and to cleaue vnto it to the end. Of the Church, becauſe by this meanes they that belong vnto it are better proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded for, touching their education and inſtruction in the feare of God, and their young yeares are more eaſily ſeaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with the beſt things betimes. So then we ſee, that this cuſtome is good and lawdable in it ſelfe, ſo that there bee no abuſe of it, nor ſuperſtition in it, nor matter of neceſsity vrged vpon it.</p>
               <p>Seeing therefore children are baptized, and haue by this meanes an aſſurance giuen them of their baptiſme: they haue a maruailous benefit beſtowed vpon them, that they ſo ſoone obtaine the partaking of Chriſt and all his bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits. God worketh in the Children of the faithfull belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to his couenant by waies vnknowne to vs, as<note n="d" place="margin">Luk. 1, 15.41</note> 
                  <hi>Iohn Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſt is ſaid to be filled with the Holy-Ghoſt fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> his mothers wombe:</hi> and they are called<note n="e" place="margin">1 Cor. 7, 14.</note> holy by the Apoſtle, inſomuch that they cannot periſh: whom God calleth, ſome ſooner and ſome later, all in his owne appointed time, as ſeemeth good to his heauenly pleaſure. The remembrance whereof, when children come to age, greatly comforteth them in the loue and feare of God, when they call to mind that they are ſo greatly eſteemed and highly regarded of God, from the firſt comming into the world, before they had the vſe of ſpeech, of reaſon, and of vnderſtanding. Chriſt Ieſus ſhed his blood for them, hee dyed for all the Children of God,<note n="f" place="margin">Ioh. 11, 52. Reuel. 20, 12.</note> he redeemed them whether they be old or young, ſmall or great, as Ioh. 11. <hi>He muſt dye, not for that nation one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, but ſhould gather together in one the children of God which are ſcattered.</hi> And the ſame apoſtle Reuel. 20. ſaith, <hi>I ſaw the dead both great and ſmall ſtand before God, and the bookes were opened, and another booke was opened which is the booke of life, and the dead were iudged of thoſe things written in thoſe bookes according to their workes.</hi> Wherefore, when children ſhall come to yeares of diſcretion and vnderſtanding, they muſt heereby be pricked forward to an earneſt care and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deuour
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:21092:140"/> to walke in the feare of God, and to ſerue him in holines &amp; righteouſnes all the dayes of their life, by whom they were receiued for ſonnes and adopted for his childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> by a ſolemne pledge of their adoption, before they were a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble through their age, to know and acknowledge him for their father.</p>
               <p>This muſt ſerue as a ſtrong confirmation of their faith, both in life and death, to aſſure them that God will neuer leaue them nor forſake them, who ſo ſoone beginneth to giue them pledges of his loue, and to ſhew himſelfe to bee their God. We ſee by common experience, that a little child comming into the world, is one of the miſerableſt and fillieſt creatures that can be deuiſed, the very liuely picture of the greateſt infirmity that can be imagined: more weake in body, and leſſe able to helpe himſelfe, or ſhift for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, then any of the beaſts of the field. The other crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures (which are alſo the worke of his hands) by the ſecret inſtinct of nature ſo ſoone as they are come foorth, ſeeke about for ſuccour and ſuſtenance. It is not ſo with chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, they can neither ſeeke their owne good, nor defend themſelues from euill. They are ready to fall into fire and water, or any other danger; they cannot take one bit of bread to feed themſelues, they cannot couer their owne nakedneſſe; they muſt be caried in our armes, ſwadled in clothes, attired in apparell, waſhed with water, nouriſhed with milke, and afterward with meat, and haue all things ſupplyed vnto them. They would ſtarue for cold ſooner then come to the fire to warme themſelues, they can do no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to ſaue or to ſerue themſelues. Thus man-kinde lifted vp into the higheſt ſeate of honour, and made little inferior to the Angels is through ſinne &amp; their reuolt from God fallen downe into the greateſt miſery, and loweſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of all wretchedneſſe. Neuertheleſſe, in reſpect of the life to come, God hath prouided much better for the ſonnes of men then for others: for they are no ſooner come into the world, but he taketh care for them, he declareth himſelfe a father vnto them, he hath commanded them to be brought vnto him, and to be baptized in his name, to
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:21092:141"/> the end that ſo ſoone as they begin to breathe, they might alſo begin to breathe &amp; liue anew or ſecond life: ſo ſoone as they begin to ſucke the milke of their mothers breaſts, they might alſo ſucke both the breaſts of the Church, and ſo finde the food of euerlaſting life. He giueth his Angels charge ouer them and receiueth them vnto mercy; he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerueth them for his heauenly kingdome, and in the meane ſeaſon offereth vnto them many tokens and aſſurances of his good will toward them.</p>
               <p>Let them therefore giue the<note n="g" place="margin">Prou. 3, 9. Lam. 3, 27, Pſal. 119, 9. Eccle. 12, 1.</note> firſt fruites of their life to God: let them learne to beare the yoke of obedience from their youth, let them redreſſe and reforme their waies by taking heed to the word of truth: and ſeeing God hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred them in their baptiſme, let them alſo remember their Creator in the dayes of their youth, and begin to be wiſe betimes, leaſt death come ſuddenly and cut them off, as the ſluggard that fore-ſloweth the ſeaſons of plowing and reaping, wiſheth for them in vaine at another time of the yeare. Thus we haue ſhewed the baptiſme of children: the certaine truth thereof hath beene euidently prooved: the obiections againſt this truth alledged, haue beene ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently anſwered: and the vſes of it to the great comfort of all faithfull parents and Children haue beene particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly remembred.</p>

               <p>Theſe inward parts do directly and fitly anſwere to the outward. The Father is repreſented by the Miniſter: the Spirit worketh by the word: Chriſt is ſealed by the water: &amp; the ſoule clenſed is ſignified by the body that is waſhed. Now,<note n="d" place="margin">The agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene the outward and inward parts.</note> there is a notable agreement, a ſingular vnion, and fit proportion betweene theſe parts, where the Miniſter hath relation and reference to the Father, the word to the Spirite, the water to Chriſt, and the body dipped to the faithfull clenſed. For euen as the Miniſter by the word of inſtitution, taketh and applyeth the water to the waſhing of the body: ſo God the Father through the working of the Spirite offereth and applyeth the blood of Chriſt, to the clenſing of the faithfull.</p>

The<note n="e" place="margin">The firſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward part of baptiſme is God the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</note> firſt inward part is God the Father, repreſented by the Miniſter.

Hence it is, that when <hi>Iohn</hi> baptized, the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther was preſent, as preſident of the worke, when loe, his voice came from heauen, ſaying, <hi>This is my beloued Sonne in whom I am well pleaſed.</hi> Now let vs come to the vſes.</p>
               <p>This ſerueth firſt of all, to ſtrengthen our faith in the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſsion <label type="milestone">

Wherefore although the Miniſter doth nothing, touching or toward the cleanſing of the ſoule: yet in regard of Gods ordinance and our benefit, the miniſtry of man is ſomewhat, which whoſoeuer deſpiſeth, doth deſpiſe GOD the the author of it. For whenſoeuer the eye of the body ſeeth the Miniſter powring on the water, and waſhing the body: we muſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold by faith God the Father, offering the blood of his owne Son to be water of life to our ſoules.

               <p>The Miniſter taketh the water and waſheth the bodye, which is a pledge of a farther thing; for then doth the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther apply the promiſe of remiſsion of ſinnes and life euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting to the perſon baptized, as if he ſhould ſpeake with a loud voice and call the party by his name, while the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward ſigne is powred on the body: I freely waſh away thy ſinnes, and giue vnto thee the pardon of them, and beſtow vpon thee eternall life, ſo that thou turne vnto me and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue in Chriſt thy Sauiour.

Wherefore, leaſt the word of ſaluation ſhould ſound in our eares in vaine, and Sacraments ioyned to the word ſhould bee preſent before our eyes in vaine; the Spirit worketh in vs whenſoeuer we come vnto them aright, he mollifieth the hardneſſe of our hearts, he frameth vs to new obedience, and aſſureth vs that God offereth to vs his owne Sonne for our iuſtificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and ſaluation.

               <p>So in the Lords Supper, to the vnbeleeuer appeareth nothing but Bread and Wine, becauſe we ſee with our eies, wee receiue with our hands, wee taſte with our mouth no more: but the beleeuer knoweth, that together with theſe ſignes, God the Father offereth the body and blood of his Sonne to be ſpiritually receiued and digeſted, Euen as he that is vnlettered and vnlearned, if he looke<note n="g" place="margin">Eſa. 29, 11, 12.</note> vpon the face of a booke, beholdeth onely blacke colours and ſpots

Chriſt ſeeing a blinde man and willing to heale him, he ſpat on the ground,<note n="m" place="margin">Ioh. 9, 6.</note> and made clay of ſpittle, and annointed the eyes of the blinde with the clay, and ſaid vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him, <hi>Go waſh in the poole of Siloam:</hi> he obeyed, he went, he waſhed, he returned ſeeing.</p>
               <p>Thus doth God by ſimple, baſe, and weak things, often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:21092:145"/> confound the mighty, ſtrong, and wiſe of the world, that no fleſh ſhould reioyce in his preſence, and croſſeth all the high conceits and proud imaginations of mans wil and wit. Wherefore, we muſt not follow our owne vnderſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, nor meaſure the matters of God by the crooked rule of our carnall reaſon. Whoſoeuer will yeeld obedience to God muſt deny himſelfe, and renounce his owne wiſedom,<note n="n" place="margin">1 Cor. 3, 18.19.</note> and become a foole that he may be wiſe in God, as 1. cor. 3. <hi>Let no man deceiue himſelfe, if any man among you ſeeme to be wiſe in this world, let him be a foole that he may be wiſe, for the wiſedome of this world is fooliſhneſſe with God.</hi>

Chriſt our Sauiour was no ſooner baptized of <hi>Iohn,</hi> but by and by he was tempted in the wildernes, as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth Math. 3, 16. compared with Math. 4, 1.<note place="margin">Mat. 3, 10. and 4, 1. Acts 7, 23.</note> When it came into the heart of <hi>Moſes to viſite his brethren,</hi> then his trouble began, and he was driuen out of the Land of <hi>Egipt.

                  <note place="margin">Acts 9, 23.</note> but when he was once baptized and made a Preacher of the Goſpell, he was neuer free fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, but was vexed with iniuries and laden with al kinde of ſlanderous accuſations. This is a meditation moſt needfull to be thought vpon. When we are baptized, we renounce the Diuell and all his workes, wee receiue the Preſſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:21092:147"/> of Ieſus Chriſt, and giue our names to be inrolled in his muſter booke: we are thereby become his ſouldiors and fight his battels againſt ſin. We haue bound our ſelues to become his ſerua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts, to do that which is acceptable to God, profitable to our brethren, and comfortable to our owne conſcience, and to adorne our liues with a godly conuerſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. But if we fight vnder the banner of Sathan,<note place="margin">Who are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uolters from their baptiſm.</note> &amp; ſwarme with looſe and vngodly practiſes, we reuolt from our bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme, albeit our names are regiſtred in the number of the baptized. Moreouer, haſt thou through weaknes and infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity fallen into ſome ſin, to the diſhonor of thy God, to the wounding of thine owne conſcience, to the ſlander of the Goſpel, or to the ſcandal and offence of thy weak brother? Haue recourſe to thy baptiſme, as vnto a board after ſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wracke, as vnto a medicine after ſickneſſe, as vnto a plaiſter after wounding, or as vnto a ſtaffe after falling: that thou maieſt receiue ſtrength, courage, and comfort to thy ſoule. For albeit baptiſme be once onely adminiſtred for the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons before alledged, chap. 1. of this preſent booke: yet it being once deliuered and receiued, teſtifieth that all our ſinnes paſt, preſent, and to come are waſhed away and ſhall be forgiuen. The fruite or efficacy of the Sacrament is not to be reſtrained and tyed to the preſent time of perſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall receiuing, but extendeth it ſelfe to the whole courſe of our life afterward.</p>

<pb n="261" facs="tcp:21092:147"/> the cleanſing of the ſoule, it teacheth that baptiſme is not to be handled in ſport. It is a ſerious action of the Church to be adminiſtred in the preſence of God the author of it, it is not as a ſtage-like geſture that may be counterfeited &amp; repreſented for a ſhew only. To this purpoſe there is requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red a cleere, plaine, and euident rehearſall of the words of inſtitution, that the promiſe made of God may be vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood of the hearers, and eſpecially a calling vpon the name of God the Father, the Son, and the Holy-Ghoſt. True it is, what manner of element is to be applyed, and what forme of baptizing is to be vſed, is limited and expreſſed in the Scriptures: but what admonitions and exhortations, or what prayers and ſupplications are to be made, the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture doth not determine nor deliuer, but leaueth it free, as ſhall bee thought fit for the edification of the Church of Chriſt. By the vertue of this inuocation of the name of God and vſing the words of inſtitution according to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement of Chriſt, it commeth to paſſe, that the ſprink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of water is made a certaine pledge of <hi>the ſprinkling of the bloud of Chriſt,</hi> 1 Pet. 1.<note place="margin">1 Pet 1, 2. Titus 3, 5.</note> a ſigne of our regeneration and of remiſsion of ſins. For what folly were it to imagine that the power of God is weaker in one Sacrament then in the other? That his word ſhould be operatiue in the one, and idle or of no force in the other? Hence it is, that the Fathers of the Church do oftentimes reaſon from baptiſm vnto the Supper of the Lord. <hi>Epiphanius</hi> ſaith,<note place="margin">Epiph. contra. haer. lib. <hi>3.</hi> ca. <hi>52</hi> Euſeb.

Wherefore it muſt be miniſtred with great re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerence, and we ſhould attend religiouſly vnto it, no leſſe then we ought to do to the word of God, and to the Supper of the Lord: foraſmuch as one Chriſt is offered, yea eaten and drunken in them all.</p>

               <p>The Goſpell is <hi>the power of God vnto ſaluation,</hi> it is the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortall ſeed of regeneration,<note place="margin">Rom. 1, 16.</note> it offereth vs the forgiuenes of our ſinnes, and worketh in vs the ſame that baptiſme and the Lords Supper, and it maketh vs one with Chriſt who is the ſubſtance of the word and Sacraments, and he is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated to vs in them both. Wherefore whenſoeuer we come to be partakers of baptiſme and to bee preſent at it, we muſt come with a reuerent and religious conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of thoſe holy actions, and ſet our ſelues with all care before the Lord, of whom wee ought earneſtly to beg and deſire his Spirit to teach vs the truth of our Baptiſme, the aſſurance of the forgiueneſſe of our ſinnes, and the purging of our conſciences from dead workes. We come often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times and ordinarily to this Sacrament, we ſee children in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corporated into the Church, and ſealed vp to be members of Chriſt, and yet ſildome or neuer remember what vow we haue made to God, and whoſe we are by our profeſsion: no not in the preſent worke doth any ſuch cogitation or conſideration enter into the hearts of many, yea the moſt ſort ſee the water ſprinkled, and heare the words pronoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, but eſteeme it little, as a matter belonging nothing at all vnto them. There is none that come to heare the word and to receiue the Lords Supper, but they thinke it pertai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth no leſſe (if not more) to them then it doth vnto others: but touching baptiſme and making any vſe at all of it, they put it farre from them, they know they are already bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed, and are to be baptized no more; they turne it &amp; paſſe it ouer ſlightly to the infant that is brought, &amp; to the well-beloued friends and neighbours that bring it, ſaying to themſelues as the <hi>Phariſies</hi> did in another caſe to <hi>Iudas,</hi>

We are alſo put in minde heereby, that we are fellow-members of one and the ſame body, foraſmuch as we haue all one baptiſme, Ephe. 4.<note place="margin">Eph. 4, 5.</note> as we haue all one Lord and Father, all one faith and hope of eternall life. Hence it is, that at the birth of <hi>Iohn</hi> the Church reioyced, comming together to haue him circumciſed. Let vs therfore be ready to ioyne together in this worke, in praier and thankſgiuing, let vs addreſſe our ſelues to be as witneſſes and approuers of it, that wee may receiue comfort by it, being euermore taught and confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med in the truth of our baptiſme, and remembring what we haue promiſed to God, that we may be carefull to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme our promiſe, and fearefull to breake couenant with him.

Howbeit this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort carrieth with it ſundry duties, &amp; putteth them in minde to be thankfull to God, who hath verified his couenant to them and their ſeed; to remember the ordinance of God, that baptiſme is the ſeale of his couenant: and laſtly, to make them diligent in nurtering and inſtructing them in true religion, that ſo their children may learne betimes to become the children of God. For what can more inſlame vs and ſet an edge vpon vs to beſtow paines and labour in the teaching and training of them vp in the feare of God and the knowledge of his waies, then to conſider that God lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth them and vs, and ſheweth himſelfe the God both of them and of vs. Laſtly, this comfort reacheth to the infants themſelues that are baptized,<note place="margin">Comfort to infants bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed.</note> when they ſhall marke that they are ſolemnly ſet into Chriſt, and receiued into the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome of the Church.

               <p>Thus we ſee, we are ſeuered from the world to haue fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowſhip with Chriſt, and are ſet once in him for euer;<note n="l" place="margin">1 Ioh. 2 19.

Shall tribulation, or anguiſh, or perſecution, or famine, or nakedneſſe, or perill, or ſword? In all theſe wee are more then Conquerours through him that loued vs: for I am perſwaded, that neither death, nor life, nor Angels, nor principalities, nor powers, nor things preſent, nor things to come, nor height, nor depth, nor any other creature ſhall bee able to ſeparate vs from the loue of God which is in Chriſt Ieſus our Lord.</hi> If once we be ioyned to him in ſpirituall mariage, notwithſtanding the difference and diſparagement betweene him and vs, nothing ſhall be able to worke our diuorcement from him.</p>
               <p>True it is, God findeth vs wallowing<note n="m" place="margin">Ezek. 16, 4.5, 6.</note> in our owne fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thineſſe, polluted in our owne blood, defiled by our owne vncleannes, he hath made an eternall couenant with vs, he hath ſpoken peace vnto our ſoules, ſaying, <hi>Thou ſhalt liue,</hi> euen when we were ſunke downe in ſinne to death, he ſaid vnto vs, <hi>Thou ſhalt liue:</hi> ſo that he will neuer turne from vs to do vs good, but we ſhall be his people, and he will bee our God, he will giue vs one heart and one way, that wee may feare him for euer, and that it may be well with vs and with our children.</p>
               <pb n="269" facs="tcp:21092:151"/>
               <p>This made the Apoſtle to write, Eph. 5, 30, 32. <hi>We are members of his body, of his fleſh, and of his bones: this is a great myſtery, but I ſpeak concerning Chriſt and concerning the church:</hi> Where he ſeemeth to allude to the<note n="n" place="margin">Gen. 2, 21.</note> firſt creation of the woman made of one of the ribs of the man, ſhaddowing and ſhewing our knitting and coniunction with Chriſt, which we haue by faith, not by nature: by vertue of the Spirit, not of the fleſh.</p>
               <p>Now as we haue ſhewed that this coniunction is made by Gods Spirit and by our faith which he hath giuen vs: ſo the meanes and inſtruments to worke it, are the word and Sacraments. This is a dignity peculiar and proper to the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect, to haue perpetuall fellowſhip with Chriſt, and to grow vp into one body with him, as he teacheth, Ioh. 17, 20, 21. <hi>I pray for all them which ſhall beleeue in me through their word, that they all may be one as thou O Father art in me and I in thee, euen that they may be one with vs, that the world may beleeue that thou haſt ſent me.</hi> If then there be not an vnion betweene Chriſt and vs, we haue no acceſſe to God the Father, being quite cut off from all hope of life and ſaluation. As then all the ſubſtance and nouriſhment of the tree commeth fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the roote, and all the vitall powers of a true naturall body, come from the head: ſo it is betweene the Son of God and vs, we haue not ſo much as one drop of the heauenly life in vs of our ſelues,<note n="o" place="margin">Ioh. 14, 6.</note> Chriſt is the way, the truth, and the life, no man commeth vnto the Father but by him.</p>

For Baptiſme cannot make a Chriſtian, but ſignifie: the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments cannot make that which is not, but aſſure that which is already made, as ſeales do not giue the right, but confirm it.

                  <hi>CHAP. XIII.</hi> Of the ſecond vſe of Baptiſme.</head>
               <p>BEing made one with Chriſt, wee are partakerss of the benefits of his death, to wit,<note n="a" place="margin">The ſecond vſe of baptiſm is to aſſure forgiuenes of ſinnes.</note> of forgiuenes of ſinnes, and of regeneration or new birth. So then the ſecond vſe of Baptiſme is to aſſure vs of the remiſsion and pardon of our ſins, that we may bee vnblameable and acceptable to God. This is ſignified by the outward ceremony of waſhing and ſprinkling, to wit, the ſprinkling of our ſoules with the blood of Chriſt for the forgiuenes of all ſins,<note n="b" place="margin">Acts 2, 38, &amp; 22, 16.</note> as appeareth, <hi>Acts</hi> 2. <hi>Then Peter ſaid vnto them, Amend your liues, and be bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized euery one of you in the name of Ieſus Chriſt, for remiſsion of ſins.</hi> And <hi>Act.</hi> 22. <hi>Ananias</hi> ſaid vnto <hi>Paul</hi> immediately af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter his conuerſion, <hi>Ariſe and be baptized, and waſh away thy ſins in calling on the name of the Lord.</hi> So the Euangeliſt wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſeth, <hi>Marke</hi> 1, 4. <hi>that Iohn did baptize in the wilderneſſe, and preach the baptiſme of amendment of life for the remiſsion of ſins.</hi> And the apoſtle maketh this vſe, <hi>Col.</hi> 2, 12. <hi>Ye are buried with him through baptiſme, in whom yee are alſo raiſed vp together through the faith of the operation of God, which raiſed him vp fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the dead: and you which are dead in ſins, and in the vncircumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of your fleſh, hath he quickened together with him, forgiuing you all your treſpaſſes.</hi> The meaning of theſe places is not that baptiſm<note n="c" place="margin">Baptiſme doth not of it ſelfe conferre grace.</note> beſtoweth or giueth forgiuenes, but only ſigneth, ſealeth, and aſſureth our pardon: euen as remiſsion of ſins and the righteouſnes of faith were not in the old Teſtame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t by circumciſion conferred, but confirmed vnto the faithful. The grace of pardon and forgiuenes of ſins, is not attained but by faith in Chriſt, ſo that the worke of baptiſme will not effect it. Moreouer we haue proued, that it is not law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to baptize ſuch as are in yeares, vnleſſe they make open profeſsion of their faith in Chriſt, and repentance from the works of the old man: wherefore they obtaine them not by the outward waſhing with water in baptiſme. So then we are no leſſe aſſuredly waſhed by the blood of Chriſt fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <pb n="271" facs="tcp:21092:152"/> the ſpots of our ſoules, then outwardly we are waſhed with water from the filth of the body. For the force of his death hath that effectuall working in cleanſing our ſoules from the corruption and filthineſſe of ſinne, which naturall water hath in waſhing our bodies. By the merit of his death we haue full forgiuenes of all our ſinnes, not onely originall but actuall, not onely paſt but preſent and to come, whoſe blood is neuer drawne dry, but is euer freſh and ful of effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacy. Therfore, the words deliuered by the miniſter in bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme at the commandement of Chriſt, namely,<note n="e" place="margin">Mat. 28, 19.</note> 
                  <hi>I baptize thee in the name of the Father, and of the Sonne, and of the holy-Ghoſt,</hi> ſhould be alwayes in our eares, euen vntill the laſt gaſpe, and by them we ought to bee aſſured of the full for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giuenes of our offences againſt God. For the blood of chriſt by which we are once waſhed, can neuer bee drawne dry, but is euer freſh full of force and ſtrength, to the continual clenſing of our filthines and iniquities, ſo that they neuer come into the ſight of God, neither are imputed vnto vs. Wherefore it is like vnto a ſealed charter, wherby is confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med that all our ſins are blotted out. We are all taught by our baptiſm, that none of the enemies of our ſaluation ſhal be able to lay any ſin to our charge. Art thou tempted to thinke that Chriſts blood was not ſhed for thee? That thy tranſgreſsions are not pardoned? That thou ſhalt bee brought to iudgement for them? Doth Sathan tempt thy tender conſcience with the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>? Thou maiſt as well doubt that thou waſt not baptized and waſhed with water, as doubt thy ſinnes are not blotted out: thou maiſt as well ſurmize thou periſhedſt in the water, as ſuppoſe thou ſhalt periſh in thy wickednes, the floods wherof howſoeuer they go ouer thy head: yet ſhall not be able to preuaile againſt thee ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and ouercome thee finally.</p>
               <p>This ſerueth to conuince diuers hereticks that are alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether ignorant of the right vſe of Baptiſme. The <hi>Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ans</hi> beleeued that baptiſme was onely auaileable to take away former ſinnes.<note place="margin">De diuin. decre. ca. de bapt.</note> But <hi>Theodoret</hi> teacheth that bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme is the earneſt of future graces, not as a razor to cut a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way onely the ſins that went before.</p>
               <pb n="272" facs="tcp:21092:153"/>
               <p>The Papiſts ſuppoſe no ſinne forgiuen by baptiſme in in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants but one ſin only, which is originall. In thoſe that are baptized being of age (whereof there is ſmall or rare vſe in theſe daies) they inlarge and extend it thus farre, as that it taketh away both originall and actuall ſinnes before bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme onely: wherein although they would ſeeme to open the Lords hand very wide toward vs, yet they are indeed notable Church-robbers, who to maintaine their bellies &amp; their luſts, do vtterly ſpoile vs, not of a piece, but of our whole ſaluation in Ieſus Chriſt, whileſt they ſend vs to our owne ſatisfactions, by prayers, faſtings, whippings, and ſuch like. Note therefore that our Sauiour ſaith, <hi>He that beleeueth and is baptized,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Mar. 16, 16. Tit. 3, 5. 1 Pet. 3, 21.</note> 
                  <hi>ſhall be ſaued.</hi> Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, Tit. 3, 5, that baptiſme <hi>hath ſaued vs,</hi> and <hi>Peter</hi> affirmeth that it <hi>doth ſaue vs,</hi> 1 Pet. 3, 21. Where the ſaluation that we haue (through faith) in baptiſme, being applied to the time paſt, preſent, and to come, that is, to all times; it is euident that baptiſme doth as well ſeale vp vnto vs the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſsion of the ſinnes that wee commit at the laſt houre of death, as the in-borne ſinne wherein we were firſt concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued in our mothers wombe. This Saint <hi>Auſtine</hi> ſaw, and therefore teacheth,<note place="margin">Auſt. de nuptijs &amp; concup. lib. <hi>1.</hi> cap. <hi>33.</hi>
                  </note> that by the lauer of regeneration and word of ſanctification all the euils of regenerate men are cleanſed, not onely ſinnes paſt, but ſuch as are committed afterward by ignorance or infirmity, ſo that great is the pardon of baptiſme.</p>
               <p>This then ouerthroweth the falſe<note n="d" place="margin">Concil. Trid. ſeſſ. <hi>5.</hi>
                  </note> doctrine of the falſe Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> the Mother of abhominations, which tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth that by the grace of Chriſt receiued in baptiſme, all our ſinnes going before it, are razed and blotted out, and leaueth nothing in the party baptized<note n="e" place="margin">Bellar. lib. <hi>1.</hi> de bapt. cap. <hi>13.</hi>
                  </note> that hath the name and nature of ſin. But albeit our ſinnes be freely and fully forgiuen for Chriſts ſake, pardoned and not imputed, coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red and remembred no more: yet the ſtaine, blot, and rem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants of ſinne remaine (though not raigne) in our fleſh, ſo long as we liue in this world, which in the end of our dayes together with the mortality and corruption of our bodies ſhall be taken away and aboliſhed. Indeed the Scripture
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:21092:153"/> teacheth, that Chriſts blood cleanſeth, waſheth, <note n="g" place="margin">Iob. 1.29. Pſal. 32.1.</note> and ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth away ſin, Ioh. 1. <hi>Behold the Lambe of God which taketh away the ſin of the world:</hi> but this is not by an actual purging of vs from all corruption, but in freely acquiting and truely diſcharging vs from the guilt, offence, and puniſhment be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God, as Pſal. 32, <hi>Bleſſed are they whoſe iniquities are for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giuen, and whoſe ſins are lightened, bleſſed is the man to whom the Lord imputeth not ſin.</hi> Therefore, though they be forgiuen, yet they remaine,<note n="g" place="margin">1 Ioh. 1, 8.</note> as appeareth, Iohn 1, 29. <hi>If we ſay we haue no ſin, we deceiue our ſelues and there is no truth in vs.</hi> And <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon</hi> in his worthy prayer ſaith, <hi>If any ſin againſt thee,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 Kings 8, 46. Rom 7, 23. Eph. 4, 23. Col. 3, 3. Eſay 64, 6.</note> 
                  <hi>for there is no man that ſinneth not.</hi> So the Apoſtle teacheth and toucheth this truth by his owne experience. Rom. 7. <hi>I ſee another law in my members, rebelling againſt the law of my mind, and leading me captiue vnto the law of ſin which is in my mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers.</hi> We are all as a filthy cloth, the fleſh rebelleth againſt the Spirit, and in nothing we can do the things we would, ſo that if God enter into iudgement with vs, wee cannot ſtand in his ſight. And if originall ſinne were extinguiſhed and vtterly aboliſhed in baptiſme, then they which are bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized, ſhould ſin no more: but we ſee they ſin againe after their baptiſme. To conclude, baptiſme is auaileable not onely for ſins before, but it is a ſeale for confirmation of faith touching the remiſsion of thoſe ſins that are commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted after baptiſme, as well as done before, as our bleſſed Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour teacheth, Marke 16, 16. <hi>Hee that ſhall beleeue and bee baptized, ſhall be ſaued, but he that will not beleeue, ſhall be dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned.</hi> Faith then beleeueth the forgiuenes of all ſinnes paſt and to come, inaſmuch as the blood of Chriſt cleanſeth fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> all ſins. And the apoſtle accordeth heereunto, Titus 3, 5, 7. <hi>According to his mercy hee ſaued vs, by the waſhing of the newe birth and the renewing of the Holy-Ghoſt: that we being iuſtified by his grace ſhould be made heires according to the hope of euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting life.</hi> Where we ſee that the promiſe of iuſtificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is generall againſt all ſinnes.

Hence it is, that baptiſme is often<note n="b" place="margin">Luk. 3, 3.</note> called the Sacrament of repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, as Luke 3. <hi>Iohn</hi> came into all the parts and coaſts a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout <hi>Iordan,</hi> preaching the <hi>Baptiſme of repentance for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>m ſs<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>on of ſinnes.</hi> So likewiſe Marke 1, 4. <hi>Iohn did baptize in the Wildernes and preach the baptiſme of amendment of life.</hi> And the apoſtle affirmeth as much, Col. 2, 12, 13. declaring that one end of baptiſme is the death and buriall of the old man by the almighty power of God.</p>
               <p>This alſo was taught in thoſe<note n="c" place="margin">1 Pet. 3, 20.21.</note> liuely types anſwering our baptiſme, to wit, the flood that drownd the old world, while <hi>Noah</hi> and his family were preſerued in the <hi>Arke.</hi> Alſo the red ſea in which <hi>Pharaoh</hi> and his hoaſt periſhed, but the people of God were deliuered. For as God deſtroyed in the waters and as it were buried in the flood the old world, but ſaued a remnant of grace: ſo doth God through Chriſt mortifie the old man, raiſe againe the new man, and ſeale them both in our baptiſme. Likewiſe as God deliuered his people out of the hands of <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> and opened them a way through the red ſea, and drowned their enemies that they ſaw them no more aliue: ſo by baptiſme hee aſſureth our deliuerance from the thraldome and bondage of ſinne (which bringeth greater ſlauery &amp; captiuity then any ſlaue is in vnder his earthly maiſter) and the deſtruction of the fleſh, that it ſhall not hurt or condemne vs. Wee are all<note n="d" place="margin">Pſal. 51, 7.

Whoſoeuer would haue the true baptiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me indeed, he muſt be clenſed within, repent of his wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, mortifie his imaginations, deny himſelfe, renounce his affections, and offer vp his ſoule and body in ſacrifice to God, that he may renew and regenerate vs: otherwiſe, it is a certaine thing, we were neuer indeed and in truth bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed.

               <p>The <hi>Iewes</hi> choſen aboue all Nations to be the people of God, were oftentimes condemned of forgery and falſhood for breaking the couenant of God, &amp; not anſwering to the truth thereof,<note n="k" place="margin">Eſay 2, 4. and 57, 3.</note> and were vpbraided with the vncircumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſedneſſe of their hearts, that they were worſe then the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then themſelues, a baſtard brood, witches children, and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy to be accounted <hi>Abrahams</hi> ſeed, to the end they ſhould bragge no more of their circumciſion, as <hi>Act.</hi> 7.<note place="margin">Acts 7, 51.</note>

<pb n="277" facs="tcp:21092:155"/> as we profite in mortification. If then we be once baptized and waſhed with water: we ſhall pay dearely for our defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling that ſacred water, which God hath appointed to ſo holy an vſe.</p>
               <p>True it is, the water of it ſelfe is as nothing, no other in ſubſtaunce and nature then that wherewith wee waſh our hands: but when once it is ioyned to the word, and apply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to an holy end, it is as it were an authentical ſeale which God hath engrauen in it. Now he that counterfeiteth the ſeale of a Prince, ſhall he not be puniſhed? Behold, bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme is the ſeale of God, which ſerueth not to ſeale con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueyances of earthly poſſeſsions as houſe and lands: but to aſſure vs, that we are called to the heauenly life: and bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth good aſſurance and warrant with it, that we be waſhed from our ſinnes by the blood of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt, and borne againe by his holy Spirit. Shall we breake all and eſcape vnpuniſhed? Let vs not then boaſt of our baptiſme, and Chriſtianity, to ſay, oh, we are baptized: we are chriſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned: we weare the badge of God: theſe things, theſe things I ſay, will coſt vs deare, if we make not our baptiſme auaile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to our ſelues and our owne ſoules by killing our cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions: for thereby<note n="l" place="margin">Eccl. 5, 3.</note> wee ſhew our ſelues like vnto the foole that maketh a vow, and immediately after breaketh it.</p>
               <p>For what a miſery is this, that ſcarce one of an hundred knoweth the right end of his baptiſme, and whereunto it auaileth? So that albeit they boaſt of the outward ſigne, yet they are no more ſound Chriſtians indeed, then <hi>Turks</hi> and <hi>Pagans,</hi> Infidels and miſcreants, inaſmuch as they are no way mortified or renewed by repentance, no way chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged in the inward man, but lye rotting in their ſinnes and remaine in the condemnation of <hi>Adam.</hi> Theſe ſhall one day finde by wofull experience, what a coſtly thing it is to take ſo deare a pawne of ſaluation at the hands of God in vaine. Indeed we beare the name of Chriſt, and we pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe the Goſpell: yet you ſhall find a great number that know not this vſe of baptiſme, nor to what end it was or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained. They doe call it indeede their Chriſtendome,
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:21092:156"/> but are altogether ignorant of the nature thereof, and are vnacquainted with the effect of it: yea they bring their children to no other purpoſe to be baptized, then becauſe it is the vſual manner and common cuſtome ſo to do, being led thereunto not by the commandement of Chriſt, but by the example of others, foraſmuch as they can giue no rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon at all of that they do. This will coſt them deerely, for abuſing ſuch a pledge-token at Gods hands, ſeeing it is a meanes wherby we are vnited to our Lord Ieſus Chriſt, and ingrafted into his death and reſurrection. Wherefore, whereas many haue receiued baptiſme in their infancy, and haue liued forty or fifty yeares in the world, without know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to what end they were baptized: it had beene better for them that they had beene borne dead, or periſhed in their mothers womb as an vntimely fruit, then to haue vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hallowed ſo holy and precious a thing.

                  <hi>feaſts of charity,</hi> as <hi>Iude</hi> ſpeaketh. But of theſe the apoſtle ſpeaketh not, when he named the Lords Supper.

<pb n="286" facs="tcp:21092:160"/> Whereas their abuſes in their loue-feaſts might bee refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med and redreſſed without this mention and remembrance of the Supper. Thirdly, to what end ſhould theſe ſolemne feaſts and bankets be called the Lords Supper, which were not inſtituted in the honour of Chriſt, but to teſtifie the mutuall loue of thoſe that were members of the ſame body, hauing God for their merciful Father, the Church for their tender Mother, and Chriſt for their elder brother. Theſe might rather be called the ſupper of men, then of the Lord, being feaſts of charity, not of piety. Fourthly, the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles drift and purpoſe in this place is to teach, that ſuch as nouriſh dſſention and diuiſion pa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Beſides, we learne heereby that tropes and figures are v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Vſe </seg>2</label> in the ſacraments, contrary to the opinion and aſſertion of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> as we make plaine by the inſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and as we conſtraine the aduerſaries themſelues to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe, as when it is ſaid, <hi>his body was broken,</hi> where the litte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall ſence cannot be retained, ſeeing a bone of him could not be broken. Likewiſe when it is ſaid, <hi>The cup is the new teſtament: the rocke was Chriſt: the bread is the communion of the body of Chriſt,</hi> theſe and ſuch like cannot be interpreted without a figure.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, ſeeing of this one action the whole Sacrament hath his denomination,<note n="h" place="margin">Acts 2, 42. and 20, 7.</note> as appeareth in many places, <hi>Act.</hi>

Neither muſt this bee accounted and accepted as an indifferent ceremony, to be admitted or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted at our own choice and pleaſure, ſeeing Chriſt Ieſus the Lord of this ſacrament commanded, the Scripture hath
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:21092:161"/> commended, the Apoſtles haue practiſed, and the Miniſters afterward obſerued the ſame,<note n="i" place="margin">1 Cor. 10, 16.</note> as the apoſtle witneſſeth, <hi>The bread which we breake<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> is it not the communion of the body of Christ?</hi> ſpeaking of himſelfe and the reſt of the Miniſters of the Church. Beſides, it is an effectuall expreſſing and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentation of the paſsion and crucifying of Chriſt, as alſo the pouring out of the wine into the cuppe of the Lord. Wherefore, they are to be accuſed and conuinced as hey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous breakers of the high ordinance of Chriſt, as we ſee in the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> who omit this breaking of the bread as impertinent and vnneceſſary, and as not ſignificant. For Chriſt Ieſus commanded his Diſciples to eate that bread which he had broken, and this breaking pertaineth to the ende of the Sacrament: ſo that it cannot bee paſſed ouer, without neglect of the inſtitution of Chriſt, and of the eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of the Supper, of which we will ſpeake afterward. The next title giuen to this ſacrament, is <hi>the table of the Lord:</hi> and it is rightly ſo called, as by a very fit name. For ſeeing it is a Supper, and a moſt heauenly banket, it is requiſite there ſhould bee a table anſwerable vnto it, that as it is the Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per of the Lord, ſo there may be a table for the adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of it. From hence we conclude diuers good vſes<note n="k" place="margin">The vſes of calling this Sacram<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>nt the table of the Lord.</note> for our further inſtruction.</p>
               <p>Firſt of all, it ſheweth that Chriſt and his Apoſtles in the celebration of the Supper vſed a table, not an altar. For al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit the apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaketh vnproperly of the table, and doth thereby vnderſtand the heauenly meate and drinke which was ſet vpon the table for all the Lords gueſts: yet withall he inſinuateth and ſignifieth the place wheron they were put, to wit, vpon a table. In like manner our Saui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our Chriſt at the firſt inſtitution of this Sacrament remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned at the table with his Diſciples, he ſtood not with the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> at the altar. Now according to the example of Chriſt and his Diſciples, muſt be the practiſe of all Churches, inaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as Chriſt ſhedding his blood on the Croſſe, had abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed all altars: and therefore the Infidels did oftentimss reproue and reproach the Chriſtians becauſe they had no altars, who on the other ſide defended themſelues, that
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:21092:161"/> their Altars are the congregations of ſuch as bow them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues in prayers, and the ſpirits of iuſt men, which ſmell as ſweet incenſe in the noſtrils of God, other Altars then theſe they acknowledge none to be among them.</p>
               <p>Furthermore, inaſmuch as the Sacrament of the body and <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Vſe </seg>2</label> blood of Chriſt was accuſtomably adminiſtred on a Table, not an Altar: of wood, not of ſtone: made moueable, not immoueable: We learne from hence that it is a Sacrament, not a ſacrifice: An altar doth inferre and preſuppoſe a ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice: and a ſacrifice is referred to the altar whereon it is of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered. But we haue not now properly any ſacrifice, for that were to account the al-ſufficient ſacrifice of Chriſt as vnſufficient and vnperfect: therefore we are not to bring altars againe into the Church. There is no vſe of altars in the new Teſtament, ſeeing the making of them together with other types and ceremonies of the olde Teſtament through the death of Chriſt is aboliſhed,<note n="m" place="margin">1 Cor 9.13.</note> as the Apoſtle teacheth, 1 Cor. 9. <hi>Doe ye not know that they which minister about holy things, eate of the things of the Temple? and they which waite at the Altar, are partakers of the Altars?</hi> And to like purpoſe. Heb. 13, 10. <hi>We haue an altar whereof they haue no right to eate, which ſerue in the Tabernacle,</hi> that is, ſuch as retaine the neceſſary vſe of the ceremonies<note n="n" place="margin">Gal. 4, 9.</note> and beggerly rudiments of the <hi>Iewes,</hi> are fallen from Chriſt. Whereby we ſee plainely and apparently, that ſacrifices and altars ſtood together, and fell together: and therefore whereas they would conclude the ſacrifice of Maſſe from the vſe of the al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tars, we may inuert the reaſon, and make it ſerue to euert and ouerthrow the ſacrifice of their Maſſe, ſeeing it is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine there were no Altars.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, we muſt obſerue that it is not barely called a ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, but the Table of the LORD: to teach vs to drawe <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Vſe </seg>3</label> neare vnto it with all reuerence and regard. If we meaſure and marke our affection in earthly things, we ſee what care &amp; curioſity is often times vſed, when men come to the table and preſence of Noble men: how much greater care and conſcience ſhould be vſed of euery one of vs, when wee come to this table, where the King of Kings and the Lord
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:21092:162"/> of heauen and earth is preſent. When <hi>Dauid</hi> would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward and recompence the kindnes of <hi>Barzillai,</hi> he charged <hi>Salomon</hi> his ſonne that the ſonnes of <hi>Barzillai</hi> ſhould ſit and eate bread at his table: how great then is the honour that God vouchſafeth to vs, permitting and appointing vs to ſit at the Table of his owne Son, of whom we ſay truely, a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter then <hi>Salomon</hi> is there. Wherefore to ſtirre vs vp to this duty &amp; deuotion, let euery one conſider and meditate thus with himſelfe, I am this day to be the Lords gueſt: I am in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uited to his Table: I am to eate of his bread and to drink of his cup: I haue not in this buſines to do with man whoſe breath is in his Noſtrils, but to deale with God in whoſe preſence I do abide, who is both a beholder and Iudge of all my actions, to whom I ſhall eyther ſtand or fall. If I come in hypocriſie he will finde me out,<note n="o" place="margin">Heb. 4, 13.</note> before whom all things are naked and open: If I come fitted by faith and ſanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by repentance, I ſhall receiue Chriſt and all his merits to my endleſſe comfort. Thus much ſufficeth to be conſidered touching this title of the Lords Table.</p>

               <p>AS we haue in the former chapter conſidered the names and titles attributed to this Sacrament: ſo now we wil ſee what the Lords Supper is. For we ſhall neuer vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand the nature thereof, except we be able to define or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe it. Therefore,<note n="a" place="margin">What the Lords Supper is</note> 
                  <hi>the Lords Supper is the ſecond Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, wherein by viſible receiuing of bread and wine, our ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all communion with the bodye and blood of Chriſt is repreſented.</hi> This deſcription is plainely proued by the<note n="b" place="margin">Mat. 26, 26.27. 1 Cor. 10, 16.17. 1 Cor. 11, 24.25.</note> inſtitution of Chriſt, by the firſt celebration of it, and by other apparent teſtimonies of holy Scripture.</p>
               <p>Firſt I ſay, it is the ſecond Sacrament, becauſe ſuch as haue intereſt in the Lord, Supper, muſt be firſt partakers of the other Sacrament: for Chriſt and his apoſtles miniſtred it to thoſe that were before baptized. And how ſhould they be continually nouriſhed and fed at his table, who are not knowne to be of his houſe, nor adm<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>

They then that are in the houſe muſt be fed and foſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in the houſe: the ſeuerall parts of the family, haue the priuiledges of the family: it is not lawfull to take the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drens bread and giue it vnto ſtrangers.</p>
               <p>Now baptiſme is the true bath of our ſoules to clenſe our ſores, and an honourable badge whereby we are dedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated to the ſeruice of Chriſt, and haue intereſt in the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiledges of the Church ſealed vp: being partakers hereof, we come with comfort to the Lords Supper.

                     </gap> that belong vnto him.</hi> If then the vncircumciſed had bin admitted, the Paſſeouer had beene prophaned. Wherefore it is not enough for vs once to bee baptized and admitted into the number
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:21092:164"/> of the people of God: we muſt alſo be partakers of Chriſts Supper. When as by baptiſme we are brought into the Church of God, wee are afterward nouriſhed by this hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly banket to eternall life.</p>
               <p>Againe, I ſay in the former deſcription, that by the bread and wine the bodye and blood of Chriſt are repreſented. Heerein conſiſteth the ſubſtance of this Sacrament: he was truely giuen for vs, and his blood was ſhed for the remiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of ſinnes, leaſt our faith ſhould wander, leaſt our hope ſhould wauer.

Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by we learne, firſt, that God doth not lye nor dally with vs when we come to his heauenly table, but doth truely offer thoſe benefits in Chriſt, which are repreſented to all that are admitted thereunto: and therefore the apoſtle ſaid,<note n="e" place="margin">1 Cor. 10.3, 4.</note> 
                  <hi>they did all eate the ſame ſpirituall meate, and did all drinke the ſame ſpirituall drinke</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Indeed many of them did receiue onely the outward ſignes and did refuſe or neglect the ſpirituall grace ſo liue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly repreſented and truely offered vnto them, but the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter was their ſinne, who laboured for the meate that peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſheth,<note n="f" place="margin">1 Ioh. 6, 27.</note> but reiected the meat that endureth to euerlaſting life.

                  <hi>take, eate, this is my body.</hi> When he biddeth vs take, doth he not giue? When he chargeth vs to eat and drinke, doth he not offer? When he commandeth vs to doe this, doth he not apply the thing ſignified? If then we come to this Supper, and depart away without Chriſt and without comfort, the cauſe is in our ſelues, he is come neere vnto vs, he ſtandeth as it were at the doore knocking being rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to enter: he mercifully offereth himſelfe vnto vs, but we refuſe him, we will none of him, we bid him depart from vs, and ſhut the entrance of our hearts againſt him.</p>

                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Vſe </seg>2</label> Againe, we ſee heere the excellent price and prehemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:21092:164"/> of the Lords Supper, howſoeuer to thoſe whoſe faith it doth not nouriſh, whoſe aſſurance it doth not confirme, and whoſe ſaluation it doth not further, it is turned into moſt hurtfull and deadly poyſon: yet it is an holy banket for the Lords gueſts, an inſtrument of grace, a medicine for the ſicke, a pledge of ſaluation, a comfort for the ſinner, an aſſurance of Gods promiſes, a ſeale of our faith, an helpe for the weake, meate for the hungry, drinke for the thirſty, and a refuge for the diſtreſſed in time of tentation. Is not this a worthy dignity? Is not this a great priuiledge and an high prerogatiue? So that we muſt highly regard and reuerently eſteeme this myſtery of our religion, and badge of our profeſsion, to the glory of God, and our owne com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort. He that is not moued heereby to a reuerent regard thereof, hath no ſparke of Gods Spirit in him, but lyeth in darkneſſe and diſcomfit.</p>
               <p>Let vs then make good vſe of it all the dayes of our lifes, and not abuſe it to our deſtruction. It is not enough to ſeeme religious, and pretend reformation of our euil waies what time we do receiue it, and to hang downe our heads like a bulruſh for a day, and immediately after to runne in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to all exceſſe of riot. We ſee how many abuſe themſelues and the Sacrament, giuing themſelues to feaſting, and ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ketting, and ſurfetting, and haue ſoone forgotten where they haue bin, what they haue done, whom they haue ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, and how they haue appeared before the preſence of the eternall God. We ſee alſo in others, how contenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and brawlings breake out (which ſeemed ſmothered and ſuppreſſed for a time) like lightning and thunder out of a Cloud, or like fire couered vnder the aſhes, whoſe flame kindleth afterward with much greater force and violence. Theſe me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> make not the ſupper an wholeſome preſeruatiue, and as it were the ſicke mans ſalue, as indeed it is by Gods inſtitution: but a ſnare to entrap them, a thorne to pricke them, and a ſword to wound them, through their owne corruption.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, hereby the aduerſaries mouths are ſtopped, and <label type="milestone">

<pb n="296" facs="tcp:21092:165"/> bleſſed preſence of Chriſt in the Sacrament. We confeſſe and beleeue, that we receiue the body of CHRIST ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily, truely, and indeed, not a naked figure, not a bare ſigne, not an empty ſhaddow but euen that body which ſuffered death vpon the Croſſe, and that blood which was ſhed and poured out for the remiſsion of our ſinnes. This Chriſt<note n="h" place="margin">Ioh. 6, 55, 56 53, 57.</note> himſelfe teacheth, Iohn 6. <hi>My fleſh is meate indeed, and my blood is drinke indeed: hee that eateth my fleſh and drinketh my blood, dwelleth in me and I in him.</hi> And againe, verſe 33. <hi>Verily, verily, I ſay vnto you, except ye eate the fleſh of the Sonne of man<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and drinke his blood, ye haue no life in you. Hee that eateth me, euen he ſhall liue by mee.</hi> So then we teach, wee preach, we publiſh, we profeſſe, that there is no other ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantiall food of our ſoules, and that whoſoeuer is not par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taker of his body and blood, is void of life, of ſaluation, of grace, and of Chriſt himſelfe. Wherefore, we ſhall ſhew<note n="i" place="margin">Chap. 10.</note> afterward, that the difference betweene the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> and vs is, not whether Chriſt be preſent in his Supper, but about the manner of his preſence; for we ſay, and will neuer flye from it, that as the outward ſignes of bread and wine are deliuered &amp; receiued, ſo they repreſent and ſeale vp to euery true beleeuer, God the Father offering and gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing, the church alſo taking, receiuing, and applying Chriſt crucified, with all the promiſes of his couenant ratified in him vnto eternall life.</p>

Then we ſhould often deſire (if we hunger after Chriſt) to ſit downe at his Table, to come to his banket: to feede of his delicates, and to be preſent at his dainties. And why ſhould any be abſent that haue faith and repentance? Why ſhould they not ſhew that they are one body<note n="k" place="margin">1 cor. 10, 17</note> by eating all of one bread? Why ſhould not ſuch apply Chriſt to their iuſtification? We know the Apoſtles oftentimes prepared, offered, and deliuered the outward ſignes of the Lords ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, exhibiting Chriſt to all the faithfull, euen euery Lords day, or firſt day of the week, and the people receiued often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times the ſame,<note n="l" place="margin">Act. 2, 41, 42.</note> as we ſee <hi>Act.</hi> 2. <hi>There were added to the

For it cannot be denyed, but it proceedeth from the ſhoppe and inuention of the Diuell (whoſoeuer were the inſtrument) to bring in this corrupt cuſtome of once communicating in the yeare, and that for the moſt part for faſhio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſake. Now to the end we might re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne neerer to the ordinance of the Apoſtles, that the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten vſe of the communion might be retained and maintai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, and that the backwardnes of the people might in part be redreſſed: it was ordained by the Canons of many chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, that euery one ſhould communicate at the leaſt thrice in the year, not that men ſhould do it no oftner, but leaſt o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe they would not do it ſo often, or peraduenture do it not at al. And if a ſuruey and examination were made, I feare it would bee found to our great ſhame and beaſtly ſlothfulnes, that ſcarce the tenth perſon hath ſatisfied the law in this reſpect in many places, regarding no time of the yeare but Eaſter. But ſeeing it is ſo neceſſary a Sacrament let euery one conſider of this holy myſtery, how fruitefull, profitable, and comfortable it is to be partaker thereof, and how dangerous to neglect and contemne the ſame. Is it not an vnkinde and churliſh part among men, when one hath prepared with great coſts and charges a rich banket, killed his Oxen and his fatlings, furniſhed his table with all prouiſion, bidden his gueſts, and ſet all things in order and readineſſe to entertaine them: were it not I ſay an vnkind and vncurteous part for thoſe that are called and bidden, vnthankefully and churliſhly to refuſe to come?

                  </note> vnworthy to pray, thou art vnworthy to heare: vnleſſe thou pray as a Parrat, and heare as an hypocrite.

                  <hi>We will not come.</hi> When the King in the Goſpell had inuited his gueſts, they began all with one minde to excuſe themſelues, and ſome refuſed, ſaying,<note n="u" place="margin">Luk. 14, 20.24.</note> 
                  <hi>I cannot come.</hi> So in theſe dayes of ſinne, albeit the ſupper be prepared, the gueſts called, and the table couered: ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny men make light account of it: and what with ſome that reply careleſly, we cannot come; &amp; what with others that anſwere deſperately, we will not come, the feaſt is vnfur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed, God is diſhonoured, the people are vnprepared, &amp; all the exerciſes of religion are lightly and ſlightly regar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded. I ſay vnto you, that none of theſe men which were bidden ſhall taſt of his Supper. Againe, another ſort are as prophane as theſe, which ſtand by as gazers and lookers on vpon them that do communicate, and yet communicate not themſelues. What is this elſe, then a further contempt of
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:21092:166"/> God? Truely it is great vnthankfulnes to depart away: for theſe depart away from the Lords table, they depart from their brethren, they depart from the heauenly anker of their ſoules: but their fault is much greater, when they ſtand by in contempt, and wil not be partakers of this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion: What can this be elſe, but to haue the Miniſter of Chriſt in deriſion? It is ſaid to all that are preſent, <hi>Take ye, eate ye, drinke ye, doe this in remembrance of me:</hi> With what face then, with what countenance, or rather conſcience, can ye heare theſe words ſound in your eares, and not bee touched? Let vs therefore be drawne and perſwaded to this duty, by the benefit that redoundeth to the worthy re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiuers and fruitefull partakers thereof: and on the other ſide, feare to offend by ſtaying and ſtanding ſtill while the faithfull are partakers of this Sacrament of the Lords Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per. Hence then are many careleſſe Chriſtians reproued, that altogether neglect this duty and intermit often com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming to the Sacrament, as if it were an indifferent thing and an arbitrary matter; for whereas they are content to heare the word oftentimes, they will not come to the Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of the Lord ſo often as the lawe requireth; and as the ſluggard is wiſe in his owne eyes, ſo haue theſe ſundry ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſes, and diuers conceited reaſons to keepe them from the performance of this duty.<note place="margin">Obiections of careleſſe men why they come ſo ſil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome to the Lords Table.</note> Let vs therefore heare what they can ſay for themſelues, and examine the chiefe obiec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions vpon which they ſtand, that ſo the truth may be clea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, the diligent reſorters to this Sacrament may be encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged, the dul and backward may be prouoked and pricked forward, and all perſons may be inſtructed aright how to behaue themſelues touching this duty.

                     <seg type="milestoneunit">ob∣iection. </seg>The firſt</label> is of ſuch as ſay vnto vs they are not prepared, what? would you haue vs come before we are ready, and prepared to it? this were very dangerous, foraſmuch as he that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiueth vnworthily, maketh himſelfe guilty of the bodye and blood of Chriſt. I anſwere, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Anſwere. </seg>
                  </label> this is to excuſe one ſin with another, and to add drunkenneſſe vnto thirſt. For it is one ſame to neglect the Lords Table; it is another ſin not to be prepared to come vnto it. Howbeit ſuch ſleeue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:21092:167"/> and ſhameles excuſes will not go for currant payment, when the Lord of this feaſt ſhall viſite his gueſts. Neither do theſe men alledge their vnpreparednes by way of ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowing for it, but rather by way of boaſting in it as it were glorying in their owne ſhame. Chriſt Ieſus commandeth vs to be ſo watchfull,<note place="margin">Mat. 24, 44.</note> that we ſhould alwayes be ready for his ſecond comming, and to meet him in the Clouds: how then ought euery ſoule among vs, to be prepared and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uided with oyle in our lampes, and with the wedding gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment on our backes, with our loynes girded, and our lights burning, that we may meete Chriſt in his ordinances, and enioy his gracious preſence in the Sacrament? If then it be euill to be vnprepared, then know that this is an idle ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe, like <hi>Adams</hi> figge-leaues that could not hide his na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kednes from God, or like the ſlothfull ſeruants pretence, who receiued iudgement from his owne mouth. Againe, others that are caſt in the ſame mould,<note place="margin">The ſecond obiection.</note> and ſmell of the ſame ſmoke, alledge for themſelues, or rather indeed againſt the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, that they are not in charity. Alaſſe ſay they, would you haue vs come in this fearefull manner, when ſuch a man and I are not friends? hee hath wronged and abuſed me groſly, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Anſwere. </seg>
                  </label> I cannot put it vp. Thus do theſe men notably be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wray both their hypocriſie and their impiety. For dare they preſume to pray vnto God, or to heare his word, brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing out malice and threatnings againſt their brethren? All ſuch hearing is in vaine, all ſuch prayers are abhomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble: they are ſacrifices no more acceptable to God, then <hi>to offer Swines fleſh, or to cut off a dogs necke, Eſay</hi> 66.<note place="margin">Eſay 66, 3.</note> What folly then and ſottiſhnes is it to come ordinarily to the word and prayer &amp; yet to refuſe to come to the Sacrament? Doth not God hate and his ſoule abhorre thy comming to his word without charity, as well as thy comming to his Supper without charity? And how canſt thou be fitte to come to the throne of grace, that art not fitted to come to the Table of the Lord? Theſe men will ſeeme to haue ſome horrour of ſinne in them, and to haue a tender conſcience toward God, as if they durſt not offend him, or once med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle with the holy Communion: howbeit they do but dal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:21092:167"/> with God, and deceiue themſelues. For who taught them, or where haue they learned to make ſcrupple of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, onely when they come to receiue the Sacrament, &amp; to be altogether careles and diſſolute of their behauiour when they reſort to the houſe of God, and performe other exerciſes of religion? Either are they ſo ſimple to imagine that God looketh to our comming to his Table, but regar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth not in what manner we come to his word? But to paſſe from this point, let them carry away theſe few rules, Firſt, that one ſinne cannot excuſe another. One ſinne may ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grauate another, and increaſe the iudgement, (for ſinne ioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to ſinne maketh the ſinner more ſinfull) but one ſin can by no meanes make another ſin to be no ſin at all, and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore neuer excuſe through thy want of charity thy neglect of Gods holy ordinance that willeth thee to come often to his Supper. Secondly, the loue of God cannot dwell in his heart that beareth no loue to his brother. Hence it is that the apoſtle <hi>Iohn</hi> ſaith, 1 Iohn 4.<note place="margin">1 Ioh. 4, 10.</note> 
                  <hi>If any man ſay, I loue God, and hateth his brother, he is a lyar: for hee that loueth not his brother whom he hath ſeene, how can hee loue God whom hee hath not ſeene?</hi> Thirdly, ſo long as they liue in this eſtate, the worſhip that they performe is not performed to GOD but to the Diuell; foraſmuch as they are his ſeruants, and his workes they do, and to him they yeeld obedience, and of him they muſt looke for their reward. They cannot pray aright, no not ſo much as ſay the Lords prayer, and if they do, they ſin in it and prouoke Gods iudgements againſt the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, ſo long as they liue in hatred and malice. I ſpeake not this as though I would haue men to do nothing, to abſtaine fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> all duties, to refraine from hearing, and forbeare from pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: but becauſe I would haue them carefull and watchfull ouer themſelues, to make conſcience of all ſinne, and then they may looke for a bleſsing at the hands of God. Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, there is another ſort that is not aſhamed to affirme,<note place="margin">The third ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iection.</note> that this often receiuing is more then needs, as if forſooth it were a worke of ſupererogation.</p>
               <p>Thus they open themſelues to the whole world, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Anſwere. </seg>
                  </label> and ſhew manifeſtly of what prophane ſpirit they are. For we haue
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:21092:168"/> not onely the word of God requiring vs <hi>often to eate of this bread and to drinke of this cup,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 Cor. 11.26.</note> but our owne weakenes and wants crying out aloud vnto vs, that we haue great cauſe oftentimes to come to his Table. And ſurely if theſe men had euer found any ſweetnes in this Sacrament, and taſted how gracious the Lord is,<note place="margin">1 Pet. 2, 3.</note> they would neuer argue thus ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurdly, I haue often receiued, therefore I need receiue no more. If thou wouldſt reaſon in this manner touching thy bodily food as thou dooſt of this that is heauenly, I haue eaten meat before, therefore I need not eate againe, there would follow the ruine of the body, foraſmuch as it muſt periſh through famine: ſo if we will not come to this ſpirituall food becauſe we haue often already eaten of it, it muſt needs bring the deſtruction of the ſoule. As then they that are in health hauing eaten liberally and plenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully of one kind of meat to day, do come with a good ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petite vnto it to morrow: ſo ſhould it be with vs touching this dyet of the ſoule, the oftner we haue eaten of it, the more we ſhould deſire it. Theſe are like thoſe carnall <hi>Iſraelites</hi> that loathed the <hi>Manna</hi> that God gaue them in the wilderneſſe,<note place="margin">Num. 11, 6.</note> ſaying, <hi>Our ſoule is dried away, there is nothing at all beſides this Manna before our eyes:</hi> ſo haue we a multitude among vs that regard not their ſoules nor the food of their ſoules, but are like thoſe that <hi>Salomon</hi> ſpeaketh of, Pro. 27.<note place="margin">Prou. 27, 7.</note> 
                  <hi>The full ſoule loatheth an hony-combe, but to the hungry ſoule e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery bitter thing is ſweet.</hi> If theſe deſpiſers of holy things would with diligence and without partiality examine their owne hearts, they ſhould finde much prophanes and great corruption to lurke in the hidden corners of it, or elſe they would neuer make it a needleſſe and ſuperfluous thing to come often, but would rather thinke they come too ſil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, and therefore deſire it againe and againe. There is none almoſt ſo abſurd as to ſay, I need not come to the word becauſe I haue heard it already: nor I haue prayed to God therefore I need not to pray any more: now it is no leſſe vnreaſonable to reaſon thus, I haue receiued often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times, therefore I need receiue no more. But as he that knoweth what it is to heare aright, &amp; hath found the word
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:21092:168"/> 
                  <hi>ſweeter to him then the hony and the hony-combe, and more to be deſired then much riches,</hi> the more he heareth,<note place="margin">Pſal. 19, 10.</note> the more hee longeth to heare: ſo if at any time we had taſted the ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of that glorious worke of our redemption, or the bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternes of the fearefull eſtate of mans tranſgreſsion and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption, wee would come verye often to this Sacrament, which is a liuely remembrance of his death and paſsion whereby we are redeemed. Let ſuch then as care not for their redemption, neither eſteeme any thing of their ſalua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, neither thinke they ſtand in need of Chriſt to be their iuſtification, let ſuch I ſay tell vs they need not come of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentimes to the Supper of the Lord: but if eyther Chriſt be needfull for vs, or his word powerfull in vs, or if we haue found that God hath beene mercifull vnto vs, let vs not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſe his bountifulnes, nor neglect the ſweet pledges of his goodnes offered vnto vs. Others tell vs plainely,<note place="margin">The fourth obiection.</note> they haue gone further then the former, they haue receiued of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentimes, and come to the Table of the Lord againe and againe, and looked for ſome fruite and benefit by it, but yet they could neuer finde or feele any profit, any comfort, or any good by it.

Hee was caſt downe into the depth of ſorrow, that we might be exalted and lifted vp. He was brought as a Lambe vnſpotted to the ſlaughter, that our mouths and our hearts might be fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led with laughter. He was ſmitten with ſtripes, that we might be ſpared. He was afraid, and aſtoniſhed, and ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed,<note place="margin">Heb. 5, 7. Mar. 14.33.</note> that we might be cheared vp and refreſhed. Finally, he was crucified and put to death, that we might be deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red and reſtored to life. This is the rich and royall feaſt that he hath made vs: this is the coſtly banket that he hath prepared for vs, and yet nowithſtanding wretched and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable men can finde no profit at all in this dainty and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licate food, that coſt the heart blood of Chriſt, before it could be dreſſed and prouided for vs. Howbeit we dare not ſo hardly cenſure al that ſay they can feele no ſuch com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort at the Communion, as we perſwade is to be reaped by it; we hope better things of many of them, albeit we thus ſpeake. For howſoeuer they do not at the preſent time and in the act of receiuing feele comfort, yet neuertheleſſe they may finde it and haue it. Wherefore conſider with me, and beare away with thee theſe fiue things. Firſt, if thou ſhouldſt vtterly abſtaine from the Supper of the Lord, it is not to be doubted, but that albeit thou feele not thy ſelfe any whit the better by thy co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ming to it, thou ſhouldſt feele thy ſelfe many degrees the worſer. And albeit thou feele not thy ſelfe after thy receiuing to be ſo good as thou deſireſt, yet if thou camſt not at all thou ſhouldſt finde thy ſelfe to be worſe then thou art. Now it is ſome good to hinder that which is euill, and to keepe from vs that which
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:21092:169" rendition="simple:additions"/> is worſe.. Thus it is with many that come to the word of God, albeit it do not worke their conuerſion yet it keepeth them from much corruption that otherwiſe they might and would fall into. Secondly, it is one thing to haue grace, and another thing to feele grace: for a man may haue grace, and yet not feele it, eſpecially in time of tentation, as a man likewiſe may haue life in him, and yet not feele it. And al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though he do not feele it through violence and extremity of the diſeaſe, yet we cannot truly conclude that he is dead &amp; without life: ſo albeit we do not feele any comfort in our hearts, it is a falſe concluſion, that therefore we are with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out comfort, <hi>we liue by faith,</hi> not by feeling.<note place="margin">Heb. 2, 4.</note> We may beleeue though we do not preſently perceiue it. God doth often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times giue faith, and yet will haue vs waite a long time for the feeling of it. <hi>Dauid</hi> had loſt his feeling, as alſo the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward ioy of the Spirite, yet euen then he ceaſed not to haue faith, and the Spirite the worker of faith, <hi>Reſtore to me the ioy of thy ſaluation, and take not thy holy Spirit from me.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Pſal. 51, 12.</note> So then faith goeth not alwayes with feeling. Thirdly, euery man muſt ſubmit himſelfe with conſcience to Gods ordinance, and then he may be aſſured he ſhall in his good time finde comfort. Let vs be ready to do for the good of our ſoules as we are content to deale for the recouery of the health of our bodies. Such as are ſicke and want health, make haſt to haue the helpe of the Phyſition, and they continue to vſe his counſell, albeit they finde not preſent helpe. Let vs do likewiſe in ſeeking the health of our ſoules; we muſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed to vſe the meanes carefully which God hath ordained for comfort: and albeit helpe come not by and by out of <hi>Sion,</hi> yet we muſt not be diſcouraged but waite with pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence for the appointed time. We ſee touching our ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary meate in ſicke perſons, though they feele ſmall ſtrength and corroboration by it, yet no doubt they are ſtrengthened through it, and receiue ſome nouriſhment from it, euen while they know it not, and feele it not, or elſe they could not liue: ſo may it be with vs, wee may haue ſome ſtrength of the inner man. ſome guift of faith, and ſome comfort of the Spirite, albeit we do not
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:21092:170" rendition="simple:additions"/> ſuddenly feele it and preſently perceiue it. Fourthly, we muſt ſet downe this as an infallible rule that neuer faileth, no man was euer made better by with-drawing himſelfe from the Sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t. For be it that we haue vſed often-times the Supper of the Lord,<note place="margin">No man can be made bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter by abſtai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning from the Supper.</note> and haue found no comfort in it, nor fruite by it: do we thinke to reape any benefit by abſtaining from it, and neuer comming to it? It was neuer heard of from the beginning of the world, that any hath growne ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther richer in grace, or ſtronger in faith, by keeping him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe from any of Gods holy ordinances. This is as poſsible as it is to ſee in the darke time of the night, by keeping him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe from the light of the Candle, and abſtaining from the place where it is ſet in the Candle-ſticke to giue light to them that are in the houſe.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, we muſt not ſtint God, nor limit him a time when to make vs feele comfort, like the vnruly patient that will not be cured, except he be cured out of hand. He will try our faith and patience, whether we wil depend vpon him or not. Our Sauiour ſaith, <hi>The winde bloweth where it list<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, and thou heareſt the ſound thereof, but canſt not tell whence it commeth, and whether it goeth: ſo is euery one that is borne of the Spirite,</hi> Iohn 3, 8.<note place="margin">

True it is indeed, that ouer-common vſe of temporall things breedeth con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt, becauſe the neerer we come vnto them, &amp; the more familiar we are with them and they with vs, the more we ſee the imperfections of them, and the leſſe we ſee in them to admire them: but the neerer we come to ſpiritual things, the more we behold the excellency, and glory, and good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of them.

Neither let vs feare by our often drawing neere vnto them to run into the open contempt of them: for whether we do conſider the honour of the place where we meet, or the reuerence of the perſon before whom we appeare, or the worthineſſe of the myſteries whereof we partake, or the danger of the iudgements which we incurre by our careleſneſſe and neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence, all theſe are able to preſerue vs from a ſociety and loathing of the Sacraments, and are ſufficient to bring vs to haue a good ſtomacke to them, as the hungry man hath to his meat, and thirſty man to his drinke.</p>

               <p>The third meditation muſt be this, that it is a dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous tentation of Sathan againſt our ſoules, when he coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>celleth and perſwadeth any man to with-draw himſelfe from the Communion for want of grace, if hee haue
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:21092:172"/> any in ſincerity, albeit it be the leaſt meaſure, albeit it be but as a graine of muſtard-ſeede. The Lord regardeth the truth of grace, more then he doth the meaſure of it: and if there be in vs a ready and willing minde,<note place="margin">2 Cor. 8, 12.</note> he accepteth vs according to that which we haue, not according to that which we haue not. This Supper of Chriſt was iuſtituted for the weake, not for the ſtrong: for the poore, not for the rich: for the hungry, not for the full: for the ſicke, not for the whole: foraſmuch as the Sacrament is as phiſicke to cure him, as balme to refreſh him, as a ſalue to heale him, as wine to cheare him, as bread to ſtrengthen him, and as a ſtaffe to ſtay him. Shall any reaſonable man then reaſon ſo vnreaſonably and abſurdly<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that he will not eate, becauſe he is hungry? that he will not drinke, becauſe he is thirſty? that he will admit no plaiſter, becauſe he is wounded? that he will not take phiſicke, becauſe he is ſicke and diſeaſed? that he will not ſtay himſelfe with his ſtaffe, becauſe he is ready to fall? If we all ſee this to be a fooliſh conſequence, what vanity or rather impiety is it to yeeld to this falſe co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion, which is no better then a diueliſh tentation, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe we are weake in grace, therefore we will not come to the Sacrament to receiue ſtrength of grace, and increaſe of faith? whereas we ought to reaſon thus within our ſelues: I feele mine owne infirmities, and know how weake my faith, my hope, my loue, my repentance, and all the reſt of the graces of God are in me, I will therefore repaire with all diligence to the Supper of the Lord, which he hath ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed for the increaſing and ſtrengthening of all good things in me. The laſt point neceſſary for vs to conſider is this, that Chriſt came into the world to ſaue ſinners, and to redeeme them that were loſt, that is, ſuch as feele them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues to be ſinners, and know themſelues to be <hi>as loſt ſheepe going aſtray, and deſiring to returne vnto the ſhepheard and Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop of their ſoules,</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2, 25. True it is, God requireth that we ſhould come vnto him as wel furniſhed with grace, and repleniſhed with faith as may bee, yet hee will reiect none that preſenteth himſelfe before him with any grace, albeit he haue neuer ſo little a meaſure, prouided that theſe
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:21092:172"/> two cautions and conditions be obſerued, that the faith &amp; grace be true and ſound, not in ſhew and appearance one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly: Secondly, that there be in him an endeauor and ſtriuing for more grace and a greater faith. But if we thinke we haue enough and need no more, we haue iuſt cauſe to ſuſpect our ſelues that we neuer as yet knew what true grace meaneth. To conclude then, we muſt vnderſtand that it is not the weakenes of grace which is heere reprooued and reiected, but the contempt of grace; not ſuch weakneſſe of faith as is in the faithfull, but ſuch contempt of grace as was in the prophane heart of <hi>Eſau, who ſolde his birth-right and contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned the bleſsing, Gen.</hi> 25.<note place="margin">Gen. 25.34.</note>

               <p>The next obiection that theſe ſluggards vſe is,<note place="margin">The ſeauenth obiection.</note> that they ſay the Sacrament is as phiſicke to purge &amp; clenſe the ſoule: and therefore as it is not good to take phiſicke often, ſo it is not good to take the Sacrament often. Surely theſe are Phyſitions of no value, that cannot diſcerne a difference betweene phiſicke for the body and phiſicke for the ſoule. It is dangerous to the body to be euermore purging and ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of pils, which giue no nouriſhment to the body, but take away good humors as well as bad. It is not ſo with the Supper of the Lord, it containeth holy and wholeſome nouriſhment in it, through the ordinance of God, and can neuer depriue vs of any good guift and grace of the ſoule. Beſides, we are daily ſicke in ſoule, not in the body: and therefore we haue often need to ſeeke remedy for our ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes and infirmities. Furthermore, all phiſicke to the taſte of the body is bitter, and grieuous, and lothſome: it is not ſo with this phiſicke, it is moſt ſweet and pleaſant to the ſoule, and reioyceth the heart of euery true beleeuer. This compariſon therefore is not to be vrged farther then the point wherein it may be compared, namely, that as they that are weake and ſickly vſe the meanes and remedy of phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicke to very good purpoſe, eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> for the recouery of ſtrength and health: ſo whenſoeuer we finde in our ſelues ſpirituall diſeaſes to abound, and weaknes of faith to aſſaile vs, we muſt haue recourſe to this Sacrament to confirme &amp; ſtreng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then vs in the promiſes of ſaluation. The meaning then is
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:21092:173"/> not that as phiſicke is beſt when it is ſildome taken, ſo the Sacrament is beſt taken when it is ſildome taken. For as this Supper is truely called ſpiritual meat for vs, becauſe as meat feedeth the body, ſo the Supper of the Lord nouriſheth the ſoule: yet we cannot conclude fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> hence that we ſhould as often receiue it as we receiue our meat: In like manner, when it is reſembled fitly to phiſicke, the which being rare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly taken, worketh moſt effectually, we may not conclude that therefore the more ſildome the Sac<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

So touching the reſt of the exerciſes of our religion, it would follow that ſuch as heare the leaſt, ſhould be the beſt hearers: they that pray moſt rarely, ſhould pray moſt reuerently: and they that reſort ſildome to the houſe of God, ſhould be chiefly commended; all which we know to be contrary to reaſon, truth, piety, and religion. If a man were dangerouſly ſicke and required the preſent helpe of the Phyſition, will this patient neglect his health, and go to him at his owne leyſure, vnder colour of comming better furniſhed and prepared to tell him what his diſeaſe is?

We are all of vs as ſicke men, we haue many ſins as noyſome diſeaſes that hang about vs and beſet vs on euery ſide,<note place="margin">Rom. 6, 23.</note> (the leaſt wherof are mortall) if they be not cured by the precious blood of Chriſt: ſhall we then delay to go to the Phyſition of our ſoules vnder pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of giuing him better information of our eſtate? and laying open our ſins more throughly before him? Surely we do herein much deceiue our ſelues, while we go about to deceiue others and thinke to make them beleeue that we deſire nothing more then to come throughly prepared to this Sacrament, to which end let vs marke theſe few points following. Firſt we muſt know, that he which will not be fit to day, ſhall finde himſelfe leſſe fit to morrow, his heart will more and more be hardned, and cuſtome will turne in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to another nature, and continuance in any thing bringeth a reſolution of the hart not to giue ouer.

                  </label> we com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare theſe two in this one particular point wherein they are not to be compared. For this was the ordinance of God to his owne people, that once in the yeare, to wit, in the firſt month, a Lambe without blemiſh ſhould be killed: but touching his Supper, it is his will it ſhould be adminiſtred and receiued often-times in the yeare. How then ſhould we make them like in that point wherein God hath made them to be vnlike? And if we will tye them to the ſame time, then it ought alſo to be celebrated the 14. day of the firſt month, for then was the Paſſeouer to be eaten. This communicating once a yeare was hatched in popery when ignorance preuailed in the Church, as darknes doth in the night ſeaſon: and is by no meanes to be followed of vs. And albeit the Lord hath not tyed vs to a certaine and ſetled time, neither limited vs a certaine day or a certaine month, yet it ought not once only but often to be receiued of vs,<note place="margin">Reaſons why we ought oft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten-times to communicate.</note> to the end the death of Chriſt and his paſsion ſhould be oft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentimes remembred, that our faith ſhould be ſtrenghened, that the name of God ſhould be praiſed, and that mutuall loue among vs might be profeſſed. Hence it is, that the Apoſtle doth make mention of often eating this bread, and often drinking of the cup of the Lord,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 11, 24.25.</note> 1 Cor. 11. <hi>This do yee as oft as ye drinke it in remembrance of me: for as oft as ye eat this bread and drinke this cup<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ye do ſhew the Lords death till he come.</hi> But theſe men would not care if the remembrance of the death of Chriſt were quite buried &amp; vtterly forgotten, and

For as we muſt eate this bread and drinke of the cup of the Lord vntil he come again to iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, ſo likewiſe muſt we do it ofte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>times, becauſe his death is oftentimes to be remembred, and the mercy of God to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward vs to be praiſed and commended. And if we would conſider the zeale and forwardnes of the former times, and compare it with the dulnes, and backwardnes, and coldnes of theſe men, that would be accounted Chriſtians no leſſe then they; we ſhall finde as great a difference and contrari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety betweene them, as betweene heauen and earth. For the firſt and ancient Chriſtians neuer aſſembled together to heare the word, but withall they did receiue the Supper, as appeareth in the <hi>Acts</hi> of the Apoſtles, and the writings of <hi>Iuſtine Martyr</hi> and <hi>Tertullian.</hi> As for the example of Chriſt, he adminiſtred it no oftner, becauſe he did not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitute it before his death, to the end we ſhould know it came in place of the Paſſeouer, &amp; that it might be the more regarded and the better remembred of vs, being the laſt pledge of his loue left vnto the Church.<note place="margin">The 11. obiec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> Another obiec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion which ſome vſe to iuſtifie their ſildome reſorting to the Sacrament is this, that they haue very vrgent occaſion, and that it is not fit or decent they ſhould come at al times when others do. Chriſt our Sauiour hath appointed it
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:21092:175"/> to be common both to men &amp; women: but you ſhall heare many men alledge for themſelues as ſome haue done to me: that their wiues are ſicke, or lye in, and that they purpoſe to come hereafter with them. Likewiſe ye ſhall meet with many women, that wil pretend that their husbands are from home, or not in health, but at their returne or recouery, they purpoſe to come with them. Thus they poſt off the matter particularly, and thinke they haue ſpoken wiſely, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues very ſtrongly. <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Anſwere. </seg>
                  </label> Howbeit all this is nothing worth. For our receiuing of the Sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t muſt not depend vpon the receiuing of others, albeit they be neuer ſo deare vnto vs. When it pleaſeth God to lay ſicknes vpon vs, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth of vs another duty then to come to the Sacrament, which is, to looke to our health, to the end we may come after he hath reſtored vs: notwithſtanding, our ſicknes is no diſcharging or freeing of any other by what band ſoeuer they are ioyned vnto vs. Beſides, many there are that ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaine from the Table of the Lord in regard of the ſicknes or abſence of their wiues or husbands, who make no ſcrupple to go to the tables of their neighbours without them whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they are inuited: they can go to a common ſupper abroad, who will not go to the Lords Supper: they make no mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter at all of it to go alone to an ordinary feaſt, who cannot be intreated to come to the rich feaſt that God hath proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded: they ſtick not to be mens gueſts, that ſcorne to be the Lords: and run willingly to the houſes of men, that abſtain altogether from the houſe of God. Laſtly, if this would go for good payment, to abſent themſelues vntill their hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band or wife can be preſent with them: then it ſhould as well excuſe vs from comming to prayer and the hearing of the word vntil they might come together with vs. But the husband is bou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d to attend to Gods word without his wife, and the wife likewiſe without her husband. And we ſee the ordinary practiſe of this duty without tarrying one for ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. Therefore alſo when God calleth vs to his table, let vs not delay the time, but anſwere readily &amp; chearefully, Lord I am ready to come at thy call. The iuſt obiection<note place="margin">The 12. ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iection.</note> which I will touch is this, that many ignorant ſoules ſay for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues
<pb n="318" facs="tcp:21092:176"/> when they are told of their negligence and wretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnes, They hope they do well, they beare as good a ſoule to God as the beſt of them all, they thanke God they loue their Church and ſay their prayers duely; but indeed they were not wont to receiue their maker ſo often, they come at Eaſter as their honeſt neighbours do, and they thanke God they neuer miſſed. Theſe are they that euer ſtand at one ſtay, <label type="milestone">

They were wont to bow downe to ſtockes and ſtones: they were wont to go on pilgrimage to this and that Saint: they were wont to worſhip a piece of bread: will they therefore do ſo ſtill? wil they be as ignorant as they were before? Let them not tell vs what they were wont to do, but let them learne what they ought to do. This obiection is the ſame in ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect with the ninth, pretending that the Paſchall Lambe was offered once onely in the yeare, ſo theſe would tye it only to the time of Eaſter: ſauing that they ſtand beſides vpon their blinde cuſtome, that for-ſooth they were euer wont to come at Eaſter, and at no time beſides, yet they thanke God they haue ſped as well as the beſt, and neuer receiued hurt by it, and that now they would be loth to change their cuſtome.

<pb n="319" facs="tcp:21092:176"/> that we haue ſpent the former courſe of our life in ſuperſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and after the traditions of our fore-fathers without all vnderſtanding, and let vs walke as children of the light, being ready to learne what is the good and acceptable will of God. There are many that will ſay they hate the popiſh religion, who notwithſtanding cleane to popiſh cuſtomes, and will by no meanes depart from them. They thanke God they are no papiſts, and yet they leane too much to their reliques and rags that they haue left behind them. Let not vs make much of their rotten traſh that is not worth ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king vp, but let vs know that we haue a ſure word of the Prophets and Apoſtles whereunto we muſt attend, and by which we muſt direct all our wayes. This is the rule of our faith; this is the line and leuell to ſquare our actions: if we preferre our owne bad and blinde cuſtomes before the word of the Lord, what wiſedome can there be in vs, or how can we be aſſured to pleaſe God? Thus we haue run ouer and anſwered the fooliſh and friuolous obiections, that carnall minded men alledge in defence of their negligent comming to the Communion of the body and blood of Chriſt. Chriſt himſelfe is ready to entertaine vs as his friends, to inuite vs as his gueſts, to command vs as his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants to come to his Table: let vs then make conſcience of this duty, and not bring this curſe vpon our ſelues, to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude our ſelues from his Sacrament and from his preſence. Excommunication is the greateſt and higheſt cenſure of the Church, which as a ſharpe ſword cutteth off offenders from the Church, caſteth them out from the communion of the faith-ful, and putteth out from among them: but theſe care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les perſons that regard not to be preſent at the partaking of this Supper, do baniſh themſelues from the Citty, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicate themſelues from the Church of God. They doe willingly and wilfully caſt out themſelues, and cut themſelues off from the ſociety of his people. To conclude this point, let all ſuch ſlothfull and ſluggiſh perſons take heed, they do not exclude themſelues from this comfortable Sacrament, vnder what pretence ſoeuer it be, leaſt they bee in the number of thoſe <hi>that draw backe vnto perdition,</hi> of who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <pb n="320" facs="tcp:21092:177"/> the Lord pronounceth, <hi>My ſoule ſhall haue no pleaſure in him.</hi> Theſe things being thus rightly waighed and conſidered, let vs make conſcience of this duty, and come chearefully and comfortably to this Table. No man commeth vnto it, but he departeth better away, if he come as he ought to do. He is filled with good things, if he haue an hand to receiue them. No man ſhall repent of comming vnto it, if he repent of his ſins before he come. And when we come often, yet we ſhould be ſorry that we come not more often. It is Chriſts commandement, let vs obey it: it is his will, let vs do it: it is his counſell let vs follow it: and his comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement, his will, his counſel, is not cumberſome or burden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome vnto vs. If he ſhould require at our hands ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing that were hard or heauy to fleſh and blood, ought we not with chearefulnes to vnder-goe it, ſeeing he hath made vs, and not we our ſelues; ſeeing he hath redeemed vs, and not we our ſelues; and ſeeing he hath ſanctified vs, and not we our ſelues, ſo that all that is in vs is the Lords? How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit, that which he willeth vs to do, is not hard but eaſie: it is not a burden grieuous to be borne, to reſort often to his Supper, but light and pleaſing to them that are ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally minded. It was well ſaid of <hi>Naamans</hi> ſeruants to their Maiſter when he turned away in a rage from the Prophet, <hi>My father, if the Prophet had bid thee do ſome great thing, wouldſt thou not haue done it? How much rather then when hee ſaith to thee. Waſh and be cleane?</hi> 2. <hi>King.</hi> 5, 12.<note place="margin">2 Kings 5, 12.</note> So if Chriſt our Lord and Maiſter ſhould command vs to do greater things then theſe, and ſuch as were coſtly to vs, ought we not to do them?

                  <hi>My yoke is eaſie, my burden is light, and my com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements are not greeuous?</hi> 1 <hi>Iohn</hi> 5.3.<note place="margin">1 Ioh. 5, 3.</note> How much more when he ſaith, <hi>Eate O my friends, drinke and make you merry O my beloued, Cant.</hi> 5, 1?<note place="margin">Cant. 5, 1.</note> Surely he will do very little for a man, who being ſolemnly bidden, and friendly inuited to a feaſt by his neighbour, wil not go to his Table, but ſcorn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully refuſe, and churliſhly reiect both the feaſt and him that called him. We cannot thinke he wil do any great thing for vs, neither can we make any great account of his fauor
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:21092:177"/> and friendſhip, that will not come to ſupper vnto vs being kindly and curteouſly intreated. In like manner, what can we aſſure our hearts that we will do for Chriſt, that wil not feaſt with Chriſt? It is well ſaid of <hi>Cyprian, How will that man drinke the cup of Martyrdome for Chriſt, that will not drinke the cup of ſaluation with Chriſt?</hi> How will he ſuffer death for him, that will not reioyce with him, nor eate and drinke in his preſence? Remember therefore that the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking of this Sacrament is to our great benefit: he that ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth of this bread ſhall not hunger againe: &amp; he that drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth of his blood ſhall neuer thirſt againe. Remember that he which findeth good by any thing that he doth, needeth no great inuiting, much leſſe compelling and enforcing. He needeth no law to inforce him, the loue of it will ſufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly allure him. It is enough to compell ſuch as feele no be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit by it, and haue no regard of it. But ſuch as loue his laſt Supper and haue felt the benefit of it, and haue taſted the ſweetneſſe of this feaſt, need no compelling, nor deui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of excuſes to iuſtifie their abſence. Remember that God will not alwayes beare with our contempt, nor put vp the wrong that is offered vnto him. He is indeed very patient, and a God of much long ſuffering: he is content to warne vs oftentimes, and to with-hold his hand from puni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhing of vs; but if we abuſe his patience, we prouoke him to plague vs with diuers iudgements. If he ſend out his meſſengers, and we refuſe to come at the firſt call, he may forbeare vs: or at the ſecond cal, he may peraduenture bear it at our hands in hope of repentance: but if we harden our hearts and ſtop our eares when he calleth, he hath paſſed ſentence vpon vs already, we ſhall not eate of his Supper. For when this feaſt is kept in his Church, Chriſt himſelfe commeth among them and ſurueyeth his gueſts, he looketh for vs to meete vs at his Table; if he ſee our places often empty, be ſure he will miſſe vs, and aske for vs, and not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes ſuffer it: euen as <hi>Saul</hi> did beare with <hi>Dauids</hi> abſence the firſt day of the feaſt, and ſpake not any thing,<note place="margin">1 Sam. 20, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

                     <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 27.</note> but when his roome was empty the ſecond day, he held his peace no longer, and <hi>Ionathans</hi> excuſe ſerued not. God may beare
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:21092:178"/> with our dulneſſe and negligence for a while; but if we be abſent from day to day, and can alledge no iuſt excuſe for our abſence, we may be well aſſured he will not take it at our hands. For as a fearefull iudgement hangeth ouer his head that commeth vnprepared and eateth vnworthily: ſo is he guilty of iudgement that refuſeth to come at all. It is not enough to ſay, we come not vnworthily; for as wel neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence in not comming is a ſinne, as want of reuerence in our comming. We cannot be excuſed by pleading for our ſelues, I thanke God I am not as many others, I come not vnfitted and vnprepared to the Lords Table; I preſſe not in among his gueſts, I do not come ignorantly and vnwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thily, without knowledge, without faith, without repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, without aſſurance of the loue and fauour of God, without a ſound reſolution to liue a liuely me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber of Chriſt, withou meditation of the benefits of his paſsion, &amp; with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out acknowledgement of the greatneſſe of the mercy ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed toward vs, by conſideration of the greatneſſe of the tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that was prepared for vs: for all this we may do, and yet be condemned for not comming at all. And let vs marke this as the laſt point and take it as a farewell, that the cauſe of all theſe excuſes and colourable pretences is, the ſuffering of ſome one maiſter-ſinne to raigne in vs, there is one predominant or capitall ſinne that thus hath the vpper hand ouer vs, the which till it be pulled vp by the rootes, will <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Let vs therefore learne betimes to prepare our ſelues by humiliation, by confeſsion, by prayer, and by be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wailing the want or weakeneſſe of grace in vs, that ſo iudging our ſelues for our ſinnes, we may not be iudged of the Lord.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. III.</hi> Of the firſt outward part of the Lords Supper.</head>
               <p>HItherto we haue ſhewed what the Lords ſupper is, and how to apply it to our inſtruction: now we are to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider in this Sacrament two things, his parts and his vſes: as we haue ſhewed in the former bookes. The parts are partly outward and partly inward. A man is a compound creature made of fleſh and of a reaſonable ſoule, as <hi>Athanaſius</hi> ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth in his Creed. If the queſtion were asked, whether man were a mortall creature or immortall, earthly or heauenly, viſible or inuiſible: no man could rightly anſwere without a diſtinction, that he is earthly touching his body, and hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly touching his Spirit. In like ſort we muſt conſider touching the Lords Supper, which is made of an earthly and an heauenly thing: and therefore if the queſtion were demanded touching this Sacrament, whether it be an earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly or heauenly thing, we may anſwere it is both, and muſt reſolue that in part it is earthly, and in part heauenly: earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in the ſigne, and heauenly in the matter that is ſignified. Let vs vnderſtand this well, and acknowledge the diuers na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures and parts of it. There had neuer riſen ſo great diui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion and confuſion in the Church touching the Sacrament, if this diſtinction had beene well obſerued. The igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of this point hath bred much ſtrife and debate: for whilſt ſome iudge of it according to the inward thing, and ſome according to the outward onely, the truth of the Lords Supper hath beene buried in ſilence: both ſorts forgetting that the prouidence of God and his louing kindneſſe did a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſe it ſelfe vnto our capacity, not onely yeelding words to our eares, but viſible ſignes to our eyes, whereby he would exhibite to our faith ſpirituall things. The outward part is one thing, the inward part is another thing: the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward is taken in at the mouth, the inward by the inward man: the outward is turned into the nouriſhment of the body, the inward worketh in vs to eternal life: the outward
<pb n="324" facs="tcp:21092:179"/> is taken by ſome to their deſtruction, but the inward al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies to ſaluation. This appeareth euidently by the words of the Apoſtle deliuering to the Church what he had recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued of the Lord, and declaring how the ſame night he was betrayed, <hi>Hee tooke bread, and</hi>
                  <note n="a" place="margin">1 Cor. 11, 23 22, 25 Mat 26, 26. 28, 29.</note> 
                  <hi>when hee had giuen thankes, he brake it,</hi> and ſaid, <hi>Take ye, eate ye, this is my body, which is broken for you: this do ye in remembrance of me.</hi> After the ſame manner alſo, <hi>He took<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> the cup when he had ſupped,</hi> ſaying, <hi>This cup is the new teſtament in my blood, this do as oft as ye drinke it in remembrance of me.</hi> In theſe words we ſee, both the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward parts propounded, and the number of them defined and determined. For heere are<note n="b" place="margin">Foure out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward parts of the Lords Supper.</note> foure outward parts hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, to wit, the Miniſter, the words of inſtitution, the bread and wine, and the Communicants. The firſt Miniſter there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of was Chriſt: the words of inſtitution are, <hi>This is my body giuen for you, this is the cup of the new teſtament in my blood:</hi> the ſignes are bread and wine: the firſt Communicants were the Apoſtles. So then the Miniſters muſt do that which Chriſt did, and the people that which the Diſciples did: the acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Chriſt are directions to the Miniſter, the actions of the Apoſtles are directions to the people.</p>
               <p>I am not ignorant that it ſeemeth hard and harſh to ſome, to make the Miniſter and receiuer of the Sacrament to bee parts thereof. I am not willing to contend about words and names where we agree in the ſubſtance of the matter, foraſmuch as euery one confeſſeth that theſe two are out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward things, which being wanting, there can be no Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Againe, I haue declared in the firſt booke, and the fourth chapter, in what ſence I call them parts, to wit, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Miniſter ſtandeth in the place of God, and his out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward actions do repreſent the inward actions of God the Father, as is farther proued in the 8. chap. of this booke: and the receiuer doth nothing in receiuing, in eating, and in drinking, but it hath his inward ſignification, as we may ſee in the 11. chap. following.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, I would haue the indifferent reader vnderſtand that I ſay no more then others of the learned haue ſaid be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore me in other words, howbeit in the ſame meaning;
<pb n="325" facs="tcp:21092:179"/> who make two kinds of ſignes, the one elementall, the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther rituall: the one in the matter, the other in the forme. The ſignes elementall in this Sacrament are the bread and wine: the ſignes rituall are the giuing and taking of the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lements, which are the proper actions of the Miniſter and of the receiuer. Whether therefore you call the Miniſter and the receiuer ſignes or parts, or outward things, it is not greatly materiall, ſo that we confeſſe and ioyne toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in this, that the outward actions performed as well by the one as the other, haue a relation to ſome other thing reſembled by them.</p>
               <p>Let vs then ſee the actions of Chriſt. He tooke bread, he bleſſed, he brake the bread, he poured out the Wine, he diſtributed and deliuered them both. Wherefore the acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and workes of the Miniſter are<note n="c" place="margin">Foure acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the Miniſter.</note> foure-fold. Firſt, to take the bread and wine into his hands after the example of Chriſt, who did it to ſhew that himſelfe willingly giueth himſelfe for his Church, which ſerueth to ſtrengthen our faith and perſwaſion of his loue toward vs: in whoſe imita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion the Miniſter doth it, to repreſent the action of God the Father, giuing his Son vnto vs for our full redemption. The ſecond action is bleſsing and giuing of thanks, that is, by prayer, by thankſgiuing, and by rehearſall of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes of God, together with the inſtitution of Chriſt, actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally to ſeparate the bread and wine ſo taken from their co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon vſe to an holy vſe. Wherby we are giue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to vnderſtand, that the outward creatures are reuerently to be vſed, calling vpon the name of God, and crauing his aſſiſtance to vſe his ordinance as we ought to do: and that we ſhould ioyfully praiſe God, for the gracious work of our ful redemption by Chriſt.</p>
               <p>The third action is breaking the bread &amp; pouring out the wine, which are neceſſary rites to be obſerued, hauing re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect &amp; relation to the vnſpeakable torments of Chriſt for vs, who was pierced, crucified, &amp; made a curſe for vs vpon the Croſſe,<note n="d" place="margin">Pſal. 22, 16. Eſay 53<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>5.</note> as the Prophet teacheth, <hi>He was wounded for our tranſgreſsions, he was broken for our iniquities, the chaſtiſement of our peace was vpon him, &amp; with his ſtripes we are healed.</hi> Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:21092:180"/> theſe Sacramentall rites of breaking and pouring out are not to be reiected and omitted, being vſed by<note n="e" place="margin">Mat. 26, 26. Act. 2, 42. 1 Cor. 10, 16.</note> Chriſt, practiſed by his Apoſtles, and retained by the Churches.

               <p>So then, we ſee that whole bread is not to be deliuered, but that the bread is to be broken, and the wine to be pou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red out, to be diſtributed among ſundry Communicants. The laſt action of the Miniſter, is to diſtribute the bread and wine and giue them into the hands of the people preſent. Chriſt did not offer them vp to God, but deliuered them to his Diſciples.

They may indeed apply to themſelues the outward ſignes, they may eate the bread and drinke the wine, and in reſpect of the ſacramentall rites do as the Miniſter doth: yet for that they do it without a calling, it is not a due adminiſtration, but a true prophanation of this Sacrament of the Supper. For let vs a little inſiſt vpon the ſimilitude before ſtood vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: If the keeper of the Princes broad ſeale be not in the way, or for the preſent be not to be gotten, ſhall any man preſume to take it where it lieth without direction, &amp; with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out commandement? Such a one worthily beareth his pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment, whoſoeuer he be. In like manner, albeit one ſhould earneſtly deſire the Sacrament of the body &amp; blood of Chriſt, and euen faint in ſoule for the fruition of it, find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing himſelf in his longing affection able to take it himſelfe, without the aſsiſtance of another: yet euery one muſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider his guifts, his ſtanding, his calling, and place wherein God hath ſet him, he hath not committed to priuate per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons the adminiſtration of the Sacraments: they may not preach the Goſpell, they may not baptize their children, they may not meddle with the Lords Supper, no more then common ſubiects may take the Princes ſeale, if the keeper be not in the way. Againſt this euident truth,<note n="i" place="margin">Two obiec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding that pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uate me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> may deliuer the Supper.</note> two things of importance may be obiected, which I purpoſe to preuent before I proceed any farther. For firſt, this doctrine ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth not to agree with that maxime and principle, which before we haue reſolued vpon, namely, <hi>Accedat verbum ad elementum, &amp; fit Sacramentum,</hi> that is, Ioyne the word of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution to the outward ſigne, and there is made a Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: Secondly, it ſeemeth to leaue ſicke perſons without comfort in their hearts and peace to themſelues, if for want of a publike Miniſter, themſelues may not ſupply that want, and giue vnto themſelues this Supper. Theſe are the two obiections, pretending and intending that priuate perſons may at ſome times, vpon ſome occaſions, haue ſome right
<pb n="328" facs="tcp:21092:181"/> and intereſt in diſpenſation of the Sacraments. Touching the former point, being a ruled caſe of Saint <hi>Auguſtine,</hi>

Sacr.</note> Church to carty the Sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t vnto the ſicke when it was adminiſtred in the Church: beſides, albeit in extremity of ſicknes the Miniſter be wanting, we leaue not the ſicke without counſell and comfort. For this we teach, this we are ready to maintaine, this we would haue all beleeuers in health and in ſickneſſe to recall and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member; that if they ſtedfaſtly beleeue that the Lord Ieſus hath ſuffered death vpon the Croſſe for them, if they parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly apply vnto themſelues his precious merits for their redemption, if they earneſtly remember the benefits of his bitter paſsion with all thankſgiuing, and if they truely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent them from the bottome of their hearts of al their ſins: they do eate and drinke effectually,<note n="o" place="margin">Ioh. 6, 54, 55 56, 57, 58.</note> and to their ſoules health profitably the body &amp; blood of Chriſt our Sauiour,
<pb n="329" facs="tcp:21092:181"/> although they doe not receiue the Sacrament with their mouth. If they do not thus the Sacrament receiued can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not profite them. This ſerueth to comfort the weake, and to keepe them within the liſts and limits of their proper calling.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, ſeeing the former actions of the Miniſter are done plainely in the ſight of all, it is the duty of euery one to giue diligent heed, and to haue weighty conſideration of theſe outward ceremonies, by the meditation thereof to confirme their faith and to make the outward works to fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the inward graces. For they are offered to our ſences, not that we ſhould reſt in them, but that our weaknes by them ſhould be helped, and we by them lift vp our hearts to thinke vpon greater things.</p>
               <p>This ſerueth to reproue thoſe that omit the breaking of the bread, and deliuering of it being broken, into the hands of the Communicants. True it is, ſome make too much of the breaking of the bread, others eſteeme too little of it, and both ſorts are to be reproued, and a middle courſe betweene them both is to be retained.</p>
               <p>One ſort much more ſtreight and rigorous then is meet,<note place="margin">The firſt opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion.</note> offend in the exceſſe, who make the breaking of bread to be ſimply neceſſary and an eſſentiall part of the Supper, as that without it there can be no Sacrament. The reaſon whereupon they build, is the title giuen to this Sacrament, that it is called the breaking of bread, and this breaking of the bread is ſaid to be <hi>the Communion of the body of Chriſt,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 Cor. 10, 16. Obiection.</note> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.16. From whence they reaſon thus, The bread broken is the Communion of the body of Chriſt.

                  </label> This is a broken argument that cannot hold, and ſo weake in ſtrength that it cannot vphold it ſelfe. If one ſhould argue thus, A man is a creature go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing vpright: therefore a man not going vpright but croo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked as not a man. Or thus, The body of man hath armes, and hands, and legges: therefore if it want eyther arme, or hand, or legge, it is not the body of a man: all men ſee this will not follow. This onely will follow that ſuch
<pb n="330" facs="tcp:21092:182"/> a man is not a ſound man, and ſuch a body is not a perfect body: ſo it will onely follow that the Sacrament is not an entire but a maimed Sacrament where the bread is not bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken. Wherefore theſe men do great wrong to many re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed Churches which haue not yet this ceremony among them, while they dare pronounce that they haue no Supper at all, becauſe they are deſtitute of this rite: which iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of theirs ſauoureth of the want both of verity &amp; cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity.<note place="margin">The ſecond opinion.</note> Another ſort offend on the contrary ſide, to wit, in the defect, who make this breaking to be meerely indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent and not neceſſary: accidentall, and not of the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance. They confeſſe that the Lord Ieſus at his laſt Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per did truely breake bread, but that he did it as a thing in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different, and according to ordinary cuſtome. Beſides, they affirme that this breaking ſignifieth the diſtributing or deuiding of the bread to others. But one of theſe is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the other, the former ouerthroweth the latter, and the laſt deſtroyeth the firſt. For if Chriſt did truely breake bread in his Supper, then it followeth that to breake bread in the Supper, is not onely to deale the bread, but to giue it into ſeuerall parts being broken, as he ſaith diſtinctly, <hi>Hee brake it and gaue it to his Diſciples.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Mat. 26, 26.</note> Againe, if breaking and diſtributing be all one, then is not the breaking which they omit a rite indifferent, but very neceſſary, foraſmuch as the giuing of the Supper to the Communicants is ſo neceſſary, that without it there can be no Sacrament. Theſe there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore are they that ouerthrow themſelues.<note place="margin">The third opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion.</note> The third opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion is the ſounder of ſuch as hold a meane way betweene both extreames, that the breaking of the bread is no eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial part of the Supper, neither yet an indifferent ceremony, both which are two dangerous rockes on which ſundry me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſuffer ſhip-wrack: but a neceſſary ceremony, not as though without it there were no Supper at all, but as a part ſeruing to perfect the whole; which wanting, the Supper ceaſeth not to be, howbeit it is not intire and compleat. For this rite is not as the head or the heart in mans body, without which there could be no body, but as the hand or the foot, without which it is a body, albeit a maimed or a lame body.
<pb n="331" facs="tcp:21092:182"/> So likewiſe touching this holy Supper, without bread, without bleſsing, without giuing, there can be no Supper: it is as much as if the head were cut off, or the heart pulled out, or the braine periſhed. But without breaking, the Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per remaineth; albeit maimed and vnperfect, as if the body wanted an eye or an arme. Beſides,<note place="margin">How the brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of the bread is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary.</note> it is the will of Chriſt that this ceremony ſhould be obſerued: ſo that it may be ſaid to be neceſſary in two reſpects: firſt in regard of the making perfect of the Sacrament: ſecondly, in regard of the commandement of Chriſt. Now that this neceſsitie may appeare how great it is, let vs conſider the reaſons, wherby it is proued that this beaking, where it is, ought to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued: and where it is not, ought to be reſtored.<note place="margin">The firſt rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon.</note> Firſt of all we haue the example of Chriſt, who ſaid of himſelfe, <hi>Learne of me,</hi> euery action of Chriſt about the Supper is our inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction. But in the firſt inſtitution of the Supper he brake the bread which he had bleſſed, and did diſtribute it to his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples. Therefore it behoueth vs to do the like. <label type="milestone">

                  </label> For the Lord doth not command vs or tie vs preciſely to vſe that forme which hee vſed, and therefore if the bread be broken, howſoeuer the example of Chriſt is followed. Beſides, we are altogether ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant what forme of words Chriſt vſed in his bleſsing of the bread, and in giuing thanks to his Father, foraſmuch as it is not expreſſed by any of the Euangeliſts: may we then from hence cauill and conclude, we know not his manner of bleſsing: therefore bleſsing is indifferent and may be ſafely omitted? No, we cannot reaſon in that ſort. As then we do bleſſe and giue thankes aright albeit we know not how Chriſt did it: ſo we do well to breake the bread, albeit we know not which way he did it.<note place="margin">The ſecond reaſon.</note> The ſecond rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon is from the commandement of Chriſt, <hi>Doe ye this.</hi> And againe, <hi>So often as ye ſhall do this:</hi> heere is an expreſſe precept and a direct commandement, without this the Sacrament is as a body lame of his limbes. From hence we reaſon thus, That which Chriſt hath commanded vs to do as wel as bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing and giuing, that is neceſſary to be done: but he hath
<pb n="332" facs="tcp:21092:183"/> commanded vs to breake bread in the vſe of the Supper as well as to bleſſe it, and giue it to them that are preſent: Therefore to breake bread is neceſſary and not indifferent. The third reaſon is drawne from the example of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles,<note place="margin">The third reaſon. 1 Cor. 11, 1.</note> who following Chriſt are to be followed of vs, as 1. Cor. 11. <hi>Be ye followers of me, euen as I alſo am of Chriſt.</hi> Ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther did they vſe this ceremony according to the cuſtome of the country of Iudea, for they vſed it as well out of the borders of <hi>Iudea</hi> as in them, as appeareth in many places, <hi>Acts</hi> 2.42. and 20.7. 1 Cor. 10. So that they reſpected nor the cuſtome of the place, but the commandement of Chriſt. This is a good precedent for the Churches that profeſſe the Goſpell to follow. Fourthly, the whole Sacrament is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led by this name,<note place="margin">The fourth reaſon.</note> and hath this title giuen vnto it, to be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, <hi>The breaking of bread,</hi> as we may ſee in the places be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore expreſſed.

For it was not abrogated by the holy Supper, becauſe it is a more cleare, manifeſt, and euident type, but becauſe it was inſtituted and ordained to continue, vntill Chriſt the true Lambe of God figured by it was killed. When he was once crucified, the other killing muſt ceaſe and giue place: foraſmuch as his blood had force to ſtanch all other blood which was wont to be ſhed both in circumciſion and in the ſacrifices. <label type="milestone">

So then to take away ſignes, is to take away the Sacraments, which are nothing elſe but ſacred ſignes?<note place="margin">The ſixt reaſon.</note> Sixtly, that which includeth vnder it the myſtery of the vnion of the Church among themſelues and with Chriſt the head, is by no means
<pb n="335" facs="tcp:21092:184"/> to be paſſed ouer. But the breaking of bread hath this my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery in it, that many by partaking of one bread broken, are made one myſticall body, as the Apoſtle witneſſeth,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 10, 17.</note> 
                  <hi>We be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing many, are one bread and one body: for we are all partakers of that one bread,</hi> which he declared to be broken in the former verſe. The vnity betweene the me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bers of the Church which are many, is ſhaddowed out by the bread made &amp; compact together of many graines: howbeit this is much more eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent vnto vs by the bread which is broken and diſtributed to all that are preſent. Seauenthly, we haue the expreſſe te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony of the Apoſtle, <hi>The bread which we breake, &amp;c.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">The ſeauenth reaſon.</note> Now that is to be iudged neceſſary to be done, without which we cannot ſay with the Apoſtle in the adminiſtration and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticipation of the Supper, <hi>The bread which we breake is the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion of the body of Chriſt:</hi> but without this ceremony we cannot ioyne with the Apoſtle and ſay, <hi>The bread which wee breake, is the communion of Chriſts body:</hi> Therefore the rite of breaking and parting the bread into many pieces is neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. They may ſay, the bread which we giue or diſtribute, but not the bread which we breake: for to breake is one thing, and to diſtribute is another. Theſe two differ ſo farre the one from another, that a thing may be broken which is not diſtributed and giuen; and it may bee giuen which is not broken. Eightly,<note place="margin">The eight reaſon.</note> that which fitly ſerueth to make the Sacrament perfect and abſolute, whole and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire, may not be neglected or omitted; and where it is not, it ought to be reſtored. But the breaking of bread maketh the Sacrament inſtituted of Chriſt to be more ful, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out it to be maimed, as a man without an hand. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it ought to be reſtored againe.</p>
               <p>Ninthly,<note place="margin">The ninth reaſon.</note> it is in the power of no creature to omit or abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh any rite not in it ſelfe indifferent, but commanded by Chriſt in the celebration of his Supper. But the breaking of bread is not indifferent to be done or to be left vndone, but is expreſly commanded to bee practiſed, as we haue prooued before. Therefore no man vnder heauen hath au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority to abrogate it. For this is a true and certaine rule, that a right hauing the commandement of Chriſt for
<pb n="336" facs="tcp:21092:185"/> the vſe of it to be continued is not indifferent. Tenthly, it giueth vs peace of conſcience.<note place="margin">The tenth reaſon.</note> Now that which ſetteth the conſcience at quiet &amp; doth more effectually miniſter com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort in the vſe of this Supper, that is by no meanes to be neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected. But the due obſeruation of this breaking accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the commandement of Chriſt doth quiet the conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence and comfort the heart more forcibly and fruitfully, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſmuch as it aſſureth vs that we keepe the ordinance of Chriſt purely and entirely, without adding any thing vnto it, or without taking any thing from it: Therefore it is not to be paſſed ouer.<note place="margin">The 11. rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon.</note> Laſtly, to draw to an end, that ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ought to be retained and continued in the Church, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the Idolatrous and falſe opinion of the corporall pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence and eating of the body of Chriſt, is moſt ſtrongly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uinced and pulled out of the hearts of the ignorant people: but ſuch is the ceremony of the breaking of bread. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it ought to be practiſed, that the Idoll ſet vp in the hearts of the multitude may be defaced and pulled downe. This carnall and corporall preſence profiteth not, as we wil make plaine afterward. Thus we haue heard the reaſons which vrge and require this as a neceſſary duty belonging to the Miniſter to breake the bread, a duty neglected not onely of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> but alſo of others, who main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining a reall preſence of the body of Chriſt, omit the brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of the outward ſigne. In all this that hitherto hath bin obſerued, we may note three things. Firſt, that we do not condemne our brethren or the Churches who haue not this breaking of the bread obſerued among them, whether it be through error conceiued, or any other let and impediment obiected. Secondly, the defect of this rite cannot deſtroy, albeit it do diſfigure the Supper, it is as a maime in an whole body, or as a ſcarre in a faire face. Laſtly, that this ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny is not to be holden indifferent, but neceſſary in reſpect of Chriſts commandement, and neceſſary to preſerue the comlines and beauty in this Sacrament.</p>

               <p>But before we come to handle the vſes of this part, let vs briefly conſider the words of Chriſt deliuered at the inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution and adminiſtratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of this Sacrament, that ſo we may ſee the true and naturall meaning thereof.

                  </gap> &amp; euident, yet muſt they be vnderſtood me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taphorically, not properly: ſpiritually, not litterally. So to come
<pb n="340" facs="tcp:21092:187"/> to the words of inſtitution, What did Chriſt take in his hand? bread. What did Chriſt command them to take and eate? bread. What did he call his body? Was it any other thing then the ſame bread which he had taken, which he had broken, which he had giuen vnto them? Neither is there any other antecedent going before, whereunto it can be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred.</p>
               <p>Now the bread and body of Chriſt are in nature<note place="margin">Diſparata.</note> ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry and diuers things, and the one cannot be ſpoken of the other, and verified of the other without a figure, as to ſay, one and the ſame thing ſhould be both bread and Chriſts body, but if it be bread, it cannot be his body, if it be his body, it cannot be bread. Wherefore, true bread is a true ſigne &amp; ſeale of his true body. Neither is this figure ſtrange or new, but common and vſuall, when mention is made of the Sacraments: as Gen. 17. <hi>This is my couenant,</hi>
                  <note n="o" place="margin">Gen. 17, 10.11.</note> ſpeaking of circumciſion: yet circumciſion was not the couenant it ſelfe, but a ſigne and token of the couenant, as alſo it is af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward expounded, <hi>It ſhall be a ſigne of the couenant betweene me and you.</hi> The aduerſaries cannot deny a figure in this ſpeech. Now what difference is there betweene theſe two ſpeeches, <hi>This is my couenant,</hi> and, <hi>this is my body?</hi> are they not alike, and in like manner to be vnderſtood? So Exod. 12. <hi>It is the Lords</hi>

                  <hi>Paſſeouer,</hi> properly the Lambe was not the Paſſeouer, but ſerued to put them in remembrance of that benefit, and it is expounded after, the blood ſhall be a to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken for you vpon the houſes where ye are, this day ſhall be vnto you a remembrance. Likewiſe the Apoſtle ſaith, 1. Cor. 10. <hi>That rocke</hi>

                  <hi>was Chriſt,</hi> whereas properly the rocke was not Chriſt, but the water flowing from it did repreſent him. Thus then we muſt vnderſtand the words plainely, truely, and briefly,<note n="r" place="margin">A paraphraſe vpon the wor<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>s of inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution.</note> as if Chriſt had ſaid in this manner, This bread which ye haue ſeene me take, breake, deliuer, and diſtribute, and which I bid you take and eate, is a ſigne or Sacrament of my true body, ſignifying and ſealing vp vnto you, that my body ſhall be broken, cruſhed, and crucified for you, to purchaſe vnto you eternall life, let theſe Sacramentall rites and actions now performed
<pb n="341" facs="tcp:21092:187"/> by me and you, be heereafter put in practiſe by you and all faithfull Miniſters and profeſſors, for the ſtrengthening of your faith by the remembrance of my death, and by the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying of the benefit therof, euery one to your owne ſelues. Likewiſe, hauing finiſhed his Supper, when he did eate the Paſſeouer with his Diſciples, hauing taken the cup and gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen thankes, he gaue it being filled with wine to his Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, and ſaid, drinke ye all of this, for this wine in this cup is a ſigne &amp; Sacrament of my blood, by the ſhedding wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, together with my death following, the full forgiueneſſe of ſins and perfect ſaluation (which I by my vnchangeable wil and decree do giue vnto you and all that beleeue in me) are aſſured to you and all beleeuers. Thus hauing ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned and cleared the interpretation of the words, wee ſhall hereafter need to ſpend the leſſe time in confuting the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary doctrine: darkeneſſe ſhall flye before the light, er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror before truth, and cloudy miſts before the Sun-ſhine of the day.</p>

                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Vſe </seg>2</label> diuerſly ſet downe by the Euangeliſts and the Apoſtle <hi>Paul:</hi> we learne that euery change of the words where the ſence is nothing altered or diminiſhed, is not to be condemned, as ſinfull or vnlawfull: ſo that the alteration being in the forme and frame of words, not in the ſubſtance and ſence of the matter, the Sacrament is not deſtroyed. For if it had bin an hainous ſin to haue made any change or alteration, or to haue miſſed of the tearmes or ſillables of the inſtitution: no doubt the Euangeliſts would haue conſented in the words, and not haue ſwarued one from another, as appeareth they haue done. We ſee how the Apoſtles in the allegation of ſundry places of Scripture borrowed out of the old Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, do not euermore ſtrictly binde themſelues to the<note n="ſ" place="margin">Mat 2, 6.</note> ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry words, as Mat. 2.<hi>6.</hi> Heb. 10, <hi>5.</hi> and in ſundry other places: but onely to the ſence, and therefore<note n="t" place="margin">Mat. 4, 10.</note> ſometimes they adde as Mathew 4, 10. ſometimes they leaue out as occaſion ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth.</p>

Neuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſſe, there is nothing ſo abſurd, but the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> will defend it, eſpecially if it ſerue to maintaine ignorance, one of the maine pillars of their Antichriſtian vſurpation &amp; of the kingdome of darkneſſe. Hence it is, that to nuzzle the poore ſimple ſoules in the blindneſſe of their ſuperſtiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, they tell them that forſooth they pray to God who vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtandeth all languages; and that it ſufficeth to haue a good intent and meaning in prayer, and leaue the reſt to him who doubtleſſe will accept of it and them. True it is, God can ſpeake all tongues, he vnderſtandeth them better then they that ſpeake them: what then? Doth it follow therefore that he alloweth and approueth ſuch prayers? He vnderſtandeth that the Atheiſt prayeth not at all: doth hee therefore allow his not praying? If we come in hypocriſie or vſe vaine repetitions, he knoweth it, but condemneth it and deteſteth it: ſo that from his knowledge we cannot co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude his allowance and acceptance. Neither is it ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to haue a deuout intent of praying; to pray is to ſpeake to God, not to intend to ſpeake: neither will God be wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipped by ſuch intentions, but according to his word. And what reaſon can they render why the word ſhould be prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched in a knowne tongue rather then read vnto the people
<pb n="345" facs="tcp:21092:189"/> in a tongue that may be vnderſtood? Wherefore, whether there be reading of the Scripture, or praying to God, or ſinging of Pſalmes, or receiuing of the Sacraments in the Church, al ought to tend to edification and inſtruction. And thus farre of the ſecond outward part of the Lords Supper, to wit, the word of inſtitution: for a Sacrament without the word, is as a picture without ſence, or an image without life, which hath a mouth but ſpeaketh not.</p>

For firſt of all (to ſpeake in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>) concerning the bread,<note place="margin">Reaſons why Chriſt made choiſe of bread. Gen. 18, 6.

Secondly, as bread is baked in the Ouen by the heat of the fire: ſo is the body of Chriſt heated and boyled by the fire of the Croſſe, and thereby prepared for vs to be the food of life.<note place="margin">Pſal. 81, 16.</note> Thirdly, as this naturall life is ſuſtained by bread: ſo through Ieſus Chriſt the bread of life, our ſoules are nouriſhed to a ſpirituall and eternall life. Fourthly,<note place="margin">Pſal. 104, 15.</note> as the heart of man is ſtrengthened and fortified by bread, ſo the merit of Chriſts body doth ſuſtaine &amp; ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port the ſoule to eternall life.<note place="margin">Gen. 18.5.</note> Fiftly, as bread ſlaketh the hunger of the body: ſo the force and efficacy of Chriſts bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy doth aſſwage and alay the hunger of the ſoule. Sixtly, as bread profiteth ſuch as are hungry,<note place="margin">Eſay 58, 7. Prou. 27, 7.</note> but doth no good to them that are already filled and glutted: ſo the merit of Chriſts body bringeth a benefit to them onely that hunger after righteouſneſſe: but as for ſuch as are proud and puffed vp with a conceit of their owne righteouſnes, it yeeldeth no profit at all vnto them.<note place="margin">1 Cor. 10, 17.</note> Seauenthly, as the bread di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtributed and diuided among many is a ſigne of vnity and concord: ſo the body of Chriſt offered vp for many vpon the Croſſe; is a pledge vnto vs of his loue toward vs, and of the loue that ought to bee among our ſelues.<note place="margin">1 Cor. 10, 16, 17.</note> Laſtly, as one loafe is made of many graines: ſo we that are many are become one myſticall body of Chriſt which are partakers of one bread.

Firſt of all, as
<pb n="347" facs="tcp:21092:190"/> wine is the ſweeteſt liquor proceeding from the Vine:<note place="margin">Iudg. 9, 13.</note> ſo the blood of Chriſt is the moſt pleaſant drinke of the ſoule that was ſhed for vs, and flowed out of his ſide who is <hi>the true Vine,</hi> Ioh. 15, 1.7. Secondly,<note place="margin">Prou 9, 5.</note> as wine doth quench the thirſt of the body: ſo the merit of Chriſts blood doth take away the thirſt of the ſoule, that it ſhall neuer thirſt againe, Ioh. 4. Thirdly, as wine doth cheere vp the heart of man:<note place="margin">Pſal. 104, 16.</note> ſo the promiſes of Chriſt do cheere and refreſh the ſoule. Fourthly,<note place="margin">Prou. 31, 6.</note> as wine doth warme the body and make it more apt and fit to do buſineſſe: ſo the blood of Chriſt receiued by faith doth ſtirre vp and inflame the ſoule to all good mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and maketh vs more prompt and ready to euery good worke. Fiftly, as wine taketh away fearefulnes,<note place="margin">Prou. 23, 32.</note> and cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth men to be more bold and ſecure: ſo doth the blood of Chriſt applyed to the conſcience by faith, aſſure vs of Gods fauour, eaſe vs of the curſe of the law, and make vs conſtant in the confeſsion of Chriſt.

To begin, we learne from hence to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge a difference betweene baptiſme and the Lords ſupper; in baptiſme we haue one ſigne as the materiall part, in the Supper we haue two ſignes,<note n="e" place="margin">Why we haue two ſignes in the Lor<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

So then, albeit the ſame participation of Chriſt and the ſame waſhing away of ſins by his blood, are ſealed vp in baptiſme and in the Supper: yet the manner of ſealing them in each is diuers. Againe, baptiſme is a ſigne of our
<pb n="348" facs="tcp:21092:191"/> entrance into Gods Couenant: the Supper is a ſign of our a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biding and continuing in that couenant. Touching bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ſme, it is ſufficient for infants if they bee borne in the Church: in the Supper, the condition of examining our ſelues, and remembring the Lords death is required. They differ alſo in often celebration of them: baptiſme is to bee receiued but once onely in all our life, becauſe the promiſe once made, is alwayes firme and forcible to ſuch as beleeue and repent: but the Supper is oftentimes to be receiued, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe an often renewing of that Couenant, and calling it to our remembrance is neceſſary to increaſe and ſtrengthen faith. They differ alſo in the order which is to be obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued in the vſe of them: for baptiſme is to be giuen before the Supper, and the Supper may not be giuen to any, except to ſuch as are knowne to haue beene firſt baptized, or are at leaſt reputed ſo to be.</p>
               <p>As firſt a Child is borne, before he be fed: ſo muſt Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme go before, whereby our new birth is ſealed: then the Supper muſt follow after, whereby our daily nouriſhment is declared and confirmed. Laſtly, they differ in the ſignes, there is onely one ſigne in baptiſme, which is the water: but there are two ſignes in the Lords Supper, to wit, the bread and wine.</p>
               <p>The ſecond generall vſe is, that if Chriſt tooke, gaue, and deliuered the ſubſtance of the bread and wine: then they muſt needs retaine their former nature &amp; their proper ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, as well as their qualities, as ſight, taſte, ſmell, big<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, whitenes, ſweetnes, rednes, roundnes, and ſuch like properties. But the Papiſts turne all things<note n="g" place="margin">Againſt the bare ſhewes of bread and wine: and accidents without ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect.</note> vpſide downe, matter into forme, ſubſtance into accidents, creatures into ſhewes, and ſubiects into things adioyned: they bring in new ſhifts and fables againſt all diuinity, philoſophy, rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, ſence, and experience, ſetting vp their owne inuenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and building Caſtles in the ayre.

                  </note> conſiſting of accidents without ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect, which they are neuer able to do. For as the water in baptiſme remaineth in his nature and ſubſtance: ſo do the
<pb n="349" facs="tcp:21092:191"/> bread and wine in the Lords Supper. And albeit in both the Sacraments the ſignes be changed to a ſpeciall vſe: yet are they not corrupted into ſhewes, and turned into ſhadowes. The heauens<note n="i" place="margin">Pſal. 102, 26.</note> ſhall be changed at the end of the world: yet hence it followeth not, that they ſhall be cleane aboliſhed and conſumed to nothing.

Thus where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as in all places of learning we are taught, that accidents may periſh, not the ſubſtance of things: they will haue the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and ſubſtance to periſh, not the accidents. We ſee white<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, roundnes, drynes, moyſture: we taſte the ſweetnes: we touch all theſe qualities: yet (behold a popiſh wonder, whereat maruell and be aſtonied) theſe, theſe I ſay are not in the bread and wine, becauſe they are gone, neither in the body of Chriſt, becauſe it is not white or blacke, round or red. So we ſhall haue a white thing, yet nothing white: a round thing, yet nothing round: a ſmell, yet nothing that ſmelleth: a taſte of bread, yet nothing that taſteth: a brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king, and yet nothing that is broken: ſo that heere we haue ſomewhat made of nothing &amp; nothing made of ſomewhat. For if any ſhould aske them what round or white thing is this, ſhewing the bread? Or what ſweete thing is that, pointing out the wine in the cup? They cannot ſay it is bread and wine, (for they hold that none are left) they are not able to ſhape any anſwere: for they will not ſay the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of Chriſt is white, round, ſweete, red, or ſuch like. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, theſe accidents of bread and wine rouing without ſubiects, are ſhewes of reaſon without ſubſtance, colours without truth, and fancies without ſetled iudgement: and as wel might they imagine, walking without feete, an houſe without a foundation, a veſſell without bottome, or a body without ſpace or place.</p>
               <p>Againe, what is it that doth nouriſh? What is it that doth comfort and refreſh? For we feele our bodyes ſtreng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thened by the creatures taken and receiued. And we reade

Can drines, or moyſture, can ſmelling or ſeeing nouriſh without ſome materiall body? They cannot. It muſt be ſubſtance that is turned into our ſubſtance: for neuer was it heard, that accidents were tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned into ſubſtance. But whereas we haue bin taught, that accide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts are in their ſubiect, now we muſt hold for our new learning that ſubſtances are in their accidents. Wherefore, let vs leaue theſe doubtfull and deceitfull builders that go about to build without ground or foundation, which can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſtand: and therefore their opinion is as improbable &amp; impoſsible as the alchymiſticall tranſmutation.</p>
               <p>The third general vſe ariſing from both the ſignes, is this: if Chriſt deliuered his laſt Supper in bread and wine, then theſe ſignes may not be altered, but muſt be<note n="n" place="margin">The bread and wine be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament may not be chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged in the Lords ſupper.</note> retained for the perpetuall vſe and comfort of the Church. And howſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer it be left to the choyce and liberty of the church, what bread or what wine they wil vſe: yet that it ought neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily (as I take it) to be bread and the fruite of the Vine, may appeare by diuers good conſiderations.

True it is, circumſtances may vary and be changed, as time, place, ſitting ſtanding, kneeling, and ſuch like: but the eſſentiall parts may not be changed. If then, both of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> be of the eſſence of the Sacrament, ſuch as take eyther of them away, deſtroy the Sacrament, and bring in a nullity thereof. Wherefore, if the ſignes which are the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, might be changed: then the words alſo of inſtitution which are the forme might be altered, and a new word brought into the church: but a new word ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not be broght in, therfore no new outward ſigne or matter. Fourthly, if the bread and wine in the Supper might be changed &amp; yet the Sacrament in ſubſtance remaine: then in like manner, water in baptiſme might be changed, &amp; yet be true baptiſme; for of things that are like, there is a like reſpect, and a like con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion to be inferred. But this cannot be, as we haue ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed before in 2. book. cha. 5. where we haue proued, that the Miniſter cannot baptize with any other liquor or element, then with water, as the matter of that Sacrament. Neither let any obiect the caſe of neceſsity: for no neceſsity can make that lawfull, which ſimply and in it ſelfe is vnlawfull. Fiftly, if we admit and grant a change in the ſignes at the pleaſure of men: why may we not alſo change other parts of the Sacrament? Why may we not in ſtead of the Miniſter appointed of God and called by the Church, admit priuate perſons and receiue other alterations inforced vpon the Church by the Papiſts? Do we not heereby open a gap for them, to bring in all their traſh and trumpery beſides the written and reuealed word of God? Sixtly, we haue
<pb n="352" facs="tcp:21092:193"/> ſhewed in the former booke, that <hi>Nadab</hi> and <hi>Abihu</hi> the two ſonnes of <hi>Aaron</hi> were ſmitten by the immediate hand of God<note n="ſ" place="margin">Leui. 10, 1, 2</note> for offering the oblation with ſtrange fire. But all ſignes brought into the Sacraments beſide the Scripture, are ſtrange ſignes &amp; conſequently procure ſtrange iudgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts. And we ſee how the Prophet <hi>Ioell</hi> threatning from God a dearth of Corne, &amp; wine, and of oyle,<note n="t" place="margin">Ioel. 1, 9, 19.</note> declareth alſo that the offerings ſhall ceaſe, where he ſaith, <hi>The field is waſted, the corne is deſtroyed, the oyle is decayed, the new w ne is dryed vp, the meate offering and the drinke offering is cut off from the houſe of the Lord, the Prieſts the Lords Miniſters ſhall mourne:</hi> ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing heereby that they were reſtrained from changing the outward ſignes. If any pretend greater freedome and li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty in the time of the Goſpell: let them ſhew their char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and we will beleeue them. Laſtly, it is confeſſed on al ſides, that without conſecration and ſanctification, there can be no Sacrament: for without this hallowing, the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in baptiſme is bare water, the bread in the Supper is bare bread, the wine is common wine. Now euery creature is<note n="u" place="margin">1 Tim 4, 5.</note> ſanctified by the word of God and by prayer, as the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle teacheth, 1 Tim. 4. and therefore we cannot aſſure our hearts that God will bleſſe any other creatures, as fiſh or fleſh in ſtead of bread, water or beere in ſtead of wine, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the word hath not ſanctified theſe elements for this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe. They are ſanctified by the word for the ordinary nouriſhment of our bodies, but they are not by any ſpeciall word ſanctified for the vſe of the Sacraments. If then it be ſimply vnlawful to change any thing in the matter of the Sacraments, no pretence or neceſsity can euer make it vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfull. And as when a lawfull Miniſter is wanting, a priuate perſon may not be taken: ſo when the matter ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed for the adminiſtration of this Sacrament is miſsing, another may not be aſſumed. For as well may we change the Miniſter of the Sacrament into a priuate man, as the bread and wine (being the ſignes) into another matter. If the Sacraments cannot be had according to the preciſe and pure inſtitution of Chriſt, they may lawfully be deferred or omitted: for the danger ſtandeth not in the want (as wee
<pb n="353" facs="tcp:21092:193"/> haue declared before) ſo long as wee are free from the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt of them.</p>
               <p>I am not ignorant that many learned men are of another iudgement, &amp; ſuch as are of reuerent account in the church,<note place="margin">Bucan. inſtit. loc. <hi>48.</hi> de coen. Beza. epiſt. <hi>2.</hi>
                  </note> who thinke that where there is no ſtore of bread and plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of wine ſufficient for this purpoſe, ſome other thing may be taken in ſtead of them. Thus it may come to paſſe, that we ſhall haue nothing which Chriſt commanded and ſanctified by his example, and yet boaſt that wee haue his Supper, and do that which he appointed. For whereas we make foure outward parts of this Sacrament, the Miniſter, the word, the ſignes, and the receiuer: there are that hold there is no neceſsity of the Miniſter; others, that there is no neceſsity of the words of inſtitution: others, that there is no neceſsity of the ſignes: others, that there is no neceſsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the receiuer: ſo that euery thing is quite ouerturned of one or another, and yet all would be thought to do as Chriſt did, and as he commanded them to do. But conſider heerein the difference of opinion among men, receiuing one part but not another; ſo that if once we admit any al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teration in any of the parts, we open a gap to al innouation, and bring in great vncertainty in the Sacraments. For tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching baptiſme, ſome require it to be done by a Miniſter, that thinke we are not preciſely tyed to the words of inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution, or to the element of water: others hold we are li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mited to vſe the water, but in caſe of neceſsity wee may vſe priuate men or women to baptize. So in the Lords Supper many do neceſſarily require the Miniſter and no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to adminiſter it, but do not thinke it neceſſary he ſhold vſe bread and wine, and no other element. Thus we ſee, there is no certainty when once we depa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>t from the inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution: ſo that the ſafeſt way is to cleane ſtrictly to the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of Chriſt, and then we ſhall be ſure we ſhall not doe amiſſe. Then wee ſhall bee ſure wee haue the faireſt warrant for that which we do, and lye leaſt of all open to be reproued of others.</p>
               <p>The fourth generall vſe ariſing ioyntly from both the ſignes is, if Chriſt deliuered, and the Diſciples receiued
<pb n="354" facs="tcp:21092:194"/> bread and wine as the outward ſignes of this Sacrament: then we learn that the doctrine of tranſubſtantiatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is a do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage<note n="a" place="margin">Againſt tranſubſtanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation.</note> of mans inuention.

Neither let them pretend that they haue bin anſwered already, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſmuch as no ſound and certaine anſwere can be brought vnto them, to ſatisfie vs or themſelues. Our reaſons for the preſent ſhall be theſe.</p>
               <p>Firſt, that which Chriſt tooke in his hands, he brake: that which he brake, he gaue: that which he gaue his Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, he commanded them to eate: that which he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded them to eate, he calleth his body. This appeareth by the teſtimony of<note n="g" place="margin">Mat. 26, 26. Mar. 14, 22. Luk. 22, 19.</note> the Euangeliſts, and coherence of the
<pb n="355" facs="tcp:21092:194"/> words. But he tooke bread and brake it: therefore he gaue bread, he commanded to eate bread, he ſaid of the bread, <hi>This is my body.</hi> Now if he tooke bread, but brake it not: or if he brake bread, but gaue it not: or if he gaue bread to his Diſciples to eate, but told them, not this which he gaue them, but ſome other thing beſide that, was his body: the latter part of the ſentence ſtarteth from the beginning, and the middle ſwarueth from them both.</p>
               <p>Secondly, the Apoſtle after the words of conſecration, doth oftentimes call it bread, as 1 Cor. 11. <hi>As often as yee ſhall eate this</hi>
                  <note n="h" place="margin">1 Cor. 11.26, 27, 28. 1 Cor. 10, 16.</note> 
                  <hi>bread, and drinke this cuppe, yee ſhew the Lords death till hee come.</hi> And againe, <hi>Whoſoeuer ſhall eate this bread, and drinke the cup of the Lord vnworthily, ſhall bee guilty of the body and blood of the Lord.</hi> And againe, <hi>Let a man ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine himſelfe, and ſo let him eate of this bread, and drinke of this cup.</hi> Theſe men ſay it is not bread: the Apoſtle ſaith it is bread: whether of theſe we ſhall beleeue, iudge you. So in the former chapter he ſaith, <hi>The bread which we breake, is it not the communion of the body of Chriſt?</hi> Likewiſe, tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching the other ſigne,<note n="i" place="margin">Mat. 26, 29.</note> our Sauiour expreſly calleth it wine after the thankſgiuing, Mat. 26. <hi>I will not drinke henceforth of this fruite of the Vine vntill that day, when I ſhall drinke it new with you in my Fathers kingdome.</hi> This fruite of the Vine is wine, therefore the ſubſtance of it remaineth. Now if the bread had bin turned into the body, or the wine into the blood of Chriſt, and if the Apoſtle would haue ſpoken pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly, he ſhould haue ſaid, As often as ye ſhall eate, not this bread, but this body of Chriſt vnder the forme of bread, the blood of CHRIST vnder the forme of wine. And againe. He that eateth the body and drinketh the blood of Chriſt vnworthily. And againe, Let a man examine him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, and ſo let him eate and take in his mouth the very bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of Chriſt his Creator. But thus the Apoſtle hath not ſpoken, neither could he ſo ſpeake truely, properly, and fitly: therefore we do truely, properly, and fitly conclude, that there is no tranſubſtantiation.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Chriſt ſpeaking of the cup ſaith, Take,<note n="k" place="margin">Luk. 22, 1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>, 19.</note> diuide it among you; and of the bread he ſaith, he tooke it, and
<pb n="356" facs="tcp:21092:195"/> brake it. But if the ſubſtance of bread be aboliſhed, or cha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged into the body of Chriſt, and likewiſe the nature of the wine turned into the blood of Chriſt, there could bee no true diſtributing or breaking: for the blood of Chriſt is not deuided into parts, neither is his body broken.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, if the ſtrength or force of tranſubſtantiation depend vpon theſe words of inſtitution, <hi>This is my body, This is my blood:</hi> then there can be no reall change before theſe words be fully finiſhed, and pronounced to the end. Therefore, when they begin to ſay, <hi>This is:</hi> what is it? What meane they, I ſay, it is? Is it any other then bread &amp; wine by their owne confeſsion, til the words be ended? So then, theſe ſentences ſhall not be true, when they ſay, <hi>This is my body, this is my blood,</hi> except they meane this bread is the body of Chriſt, this wine is his blood: wherfore bread and wine remaine, their nature is not changed and altered.</p>
               <p>Fiftly, theſe words, <hi>This is my body,</hi> muſt be vnderſtood as the words following, <hi>This cup is the new Teſtament:</hi> but the cup is not turned into the new Teſtament, nor into the blood of CHRIST: therefore the other words muſt be figuratiuely vnderſtood, not literally: for there is one re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of them both: neither can any reaſon be rendred, why a figure ſhould be admitted in the one part, rather then in the other.</p>
               <p>The 6. reaſon: Chriſt is ſaid to giue to his Diſciples that which he ſaid was his body, If then this be properly ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, we ſhall thereby make a proper Chriſt, and make him a monſter of two bodies, as they alſo make the church a monſter of two heads. For ſo there muſt be one bodye which gaue, and another body which was giuen. But it is moſt abſurd, that he ſhould giue and be giuen, hold him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe and be holden, offer and be offered: which differeth little from the<note n="l" place="margin">Theodoret de ſabul. haeretic. lib <hi>2.</hi> Auguſt. de hae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſib. cap. <hi>32.</hi>
                  </note> hereſie of the <hi>Helceſaits,</hi> who held ther were ſundry Chriſts, two at the leaſt, one dwelling in heauen a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue, the other in the world heere beneath: ſo theſe make Chriſt to haue a double body, viſible and inuiſible; a viſible body ſitting at the table, and an inuiſible body made of the ſubſtance of bread, which (as the papiſts hold) was giuen to
<pb n="357" facs="tcp:21092:195"/> the Diſciples, as likewiſe they teach of the headſhip of the Church, that one head is inuiſible to vs in the heauens, ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther viſible to vs vpon the earth.</p>
               <p>The 7. reaſon: It deſtroyeth the nature of a Sacrament, which ſtandeth<note n="m" place="margin">Iren. lib. <hi>4.</hi> cont. haer cap. <hi>34.</hi>
                  </note> of an earthly and heauenly part: one out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, the other inward: one ſeene, the other vnderſtood: one a ſigne, the other a thing ſignified: of which we haue ſpoken before, booke 1. chap. 3. But if there be an actuall tranſubſtantiation, then the outward part is aboliſhed, and diſanulled.</p>
               <p>The 8. reaſon: In baptiſme the ſubſtance of water remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth, though it haue words of conſecration, and be made a Sacrament of our regeneration: and therefore in the Lords Supper the bread and wine are not changed and done away vtterly. The Scripture ſpeaketh as highly<note n="n" place="margin">Mat 26, 26, 1 Pet. 3, 20, 21</note> of the one as of the other.</p>
               <p>The ninth reaſon: If bread be really turned into the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of Chriſt, and the wine into his blood: then the bodye and blood of Chriſt are really ſeparated, for the words are ſeuerally pronounced, firſt of the bread, then of the wine: yea the ſoule of Chriſt ſhould be ſeparated from his body, for the bread is turned onely into his body, and not into his ſoule. But his ſoule, his body, and his blood are not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally ſeparated. So then, if the bread be his very fleſh, and the wine his blood, and the one really ſeparated from the other; then Chriſt muſt neceſſarily bee ſlaine afreſh euery time the Supper is celebrated, and we are found to be cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifiers of the Lord of life: whereas it is contrary to the doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine of the Scriptures, that he ſhould dye any more, being aſcended far aboue all principalities, and ſet downe at the right hand of his Father.</p>
               <p>The 10. reaſon: If the bread be turned into his body in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed by force of a few words vttered by a Prieſt: then the Prieſt ſhould be the maker of his maker, &amp; ſo euery maſſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monger ſhould be preferred before Chriſt, as much as the creator hath more honour then the creature, the builder then the houſe, the worke-man then the worke. But they are not aſhamed to publiſh it in their owne wordes and

But the precious body and blood of Chriſt cannot be mingled with poyſon, but is an excellent counter-poyſon againſt the bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of the old Serpent and all infection of ſin whatſoeuer; the body cannot mould or putrifie, the blood of Chriſt can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not become ſharpe or ſowre, as the outward ſignes may, therefore the ſubſtance of bread and wine remaineth.</p>
               <p>The 12. reaſon: there is ſomething in the Sacrament ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teriall and ſubſtantiall, which goeth the way of all meates, according to that ſaying of our<note n="t" place="margin">Mat. 15, 17.</note> Sauiour, Mat. 15, 17. <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue ye not yet that whatſoeuer entreth into the mouth, goeth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the belly, and is caſt out into the draught?</hi> But none of the accidents, as ſhape, colour, quality, taſte, and ſuch like are auoyded, becauſe they are altered in the ſtomacke, before they come to the place of auoydance:<note n="u" place="margin">O<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </note> and it were blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my to thinke that the bodye of Chriſt either entreth into the mouth, or goeth downe into the belly, or is caſt out in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the draught, howſoeuer many of them haue alſo main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained this monſtrous impiety: Therefore the ſubſtance of
<pb n="359" facs="tcp:21092:196"/> the bread and the wine remaine in their owne nature in the Sacrament.</p>
               <p>The 13. reaſon: If there were a miraculous conuerſion of the bread &amp; wine, it would appeare to the outward ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, as Ioh. 6. The multitude<note n="a" place="margin">Ioh 6, 26.</note> ſaw his miracles. There was neuer miracle wrought by any bodily creature, but ſenſe iudged it to be ſo: but ſeeing our eyes ſee, and our taſte diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerneth that it is bread, we cannot imagine there is any mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle. The miracles that <hi>Moſes</hi> did in <hi>Egypt,</hi> when hee turned water into blood, and his rod into a Serpent: The miracles<note n="b" place="margin">Auguſt. de Trinit. lib. <hi>3.</hi> cap. <hi>

                  </note> that Chriſt did, when he turned water into wine, the eye ſaw, the taſte diſcerned, heere was no deceit, no fraud, no colluſion. And thus euery hedge-prieſt ſhould be a worker of miracles, that onely can reade his portuiſe, and ſay ouer his <hi>Pater-noſter</hi> with an <hi>Aue-mary.</hi> This is an honour that may be challenged, but cannot be granted vnto them.</p>
               <p>The 14. reaſon: If there were any tranſubſtantiation, there ſhould be an actuall conuerſion of the bread into the body of Chriſt; but this cannot ſtand. For when one thing is changed into another, the matter remaineth, the forme is altered: but heere they make the forme to abide, and the matter to be changed. A ſtrange <hi>Metamorpho<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>is,</hi> and fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the fable of this counterfeit turning. Now the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of bread is not in the body of Chriſt, becauſe it is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect in it ſelfe, and ſo glorified, that it can receiue no ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe. Beſides, nothing can be conuerted or changed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a thing before being and preexiſting, which was really before the change or conuerſion; as Chriſt turned the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter into that wine which was not before,<note n="c" place="margin">Exod 4, 3. Iohn 2, 8. Gen 1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

But the body of Chriſt is before their tranſubſtantiation, whereupon it followeth, that the bread cannot be changed into his body.</p>
               <p>The 15. reaſon: If Chriſt did tranſubſtantiate the bread into his body when he ſaid, <hi>This is my body:</hi> then in like manner the Apoſtle did tranſubſtantiate the Church of the
<pb n="360" facs="tcp:21092:197"/> 
                  <hi>Corinthians</hi> into the body of Chriſt, when he ſaith, <hi>Now ye are</hi>

For the whole colledge and company of Diuines of <hi>Rome</hi> and <hi>Themes,</hi> and all the multitude of Papiſts throughout the world, ſhal neuer be better able to proue their tranſubſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiation out of theſe words. <hi>This is my body:</hi> then out of the other <hi>Ye are the body of Chriſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The 16. reaſon: If the bread were turned into the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of Chriſt and receiued in the mouth, it ſhould go farre better with our bodyes then with our ſoules, becauſe our bodies ſhould really receiue the body of Chriſt, but our ſoules ſhould not<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> being ſpirits: &amp; bodies cannot be ming<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led and intermedled with ſpirits. Wherefore, we cannot beleeue and receiue this reall conuerſion of one ſubſtance into another.</p>
               <p>The 17. reaſon: If the bread be tranſubſtantiated into the body of Chriſt, and ſo receiued by vs: then eyther it is turned into our bodies, or vaniſheth away into nothing, or returneth and departeth backe into heauen. For what fourth thing they ſhould imagine, cannot bee imagined. But it is not turned into our bodily ſubſtance, for then we ſhould grow bodily into one perſon with him, hee ſhould walke with vs and reſt with vs: he ſhould eate with vs, and ſleepe with vs: he ſhould be whole with vs and ſicke with vs, finally, he ſhould liue with vs and dye with vs: al which are abſurd. Neither doth his body vaniſh to nothing, for this were horrible blaſphemy once to affirme or conceiue of the body of Chriſt Ieſus, who by this fancy ſhal be made Ieſus, and no Ieſus; Chriſt and no Chriſt; a Sauiour and no Sauiour. And if once we admit this, we ſhall alſo haue re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion and no religion: heauen and no heauen: yea God and no God. Neither doth it depart into heauen; for hee was there before,<note place="margin">Act 3, 21.</note> and the heauens containe him vntill the times of reſtitution of all things. Beſides, he ſhould euery
<pb facs="tcp:21092:197"/> day aſcend; which ouerthroweth our faith, and withall o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerturneth the truth of his aſcenſion, and bringeth in a ſtrange maner of his taking vp, neuer beleeued, or receiued, or deliuered, or dreamed of in the Church. Furthermore, as the body of Chriſt is firſt ſuppoſed to be receiued and then the blood: ſo the body ſhould firſt aſce<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d without the blood, and afterward the blood alone without the body. Laſtly, as wel we may hold and beleeue, that he dyeth often, riſeth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine often, is conceiued and borne oftentimes, as hold his continual and daily aſcenſion. Thus alſo we may reaſon co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the wine: If it be turned into the blood of Chriſt, what becommeth of that blood? Either it muſt neceſſarily paſſe into our ſubſtance: and then Chriſts blood ſhould be mingled with our blood, as the blood of the <hi>Galileans</hi> was mingled with their ſacrifices, Lu. 13.<note place="margin">Luk. 13, 1.</note> Or elſe it muſt periſh and come to nothing: and then it ſhould dry vp as water, and vaniſh away as ſmoake, &amp; conſume as a vapour. Or laſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, it muſt returne into heauen, which doth ouerturne his aſcending from the earth, in as much as it was there before. And as there can no other way be deuiſed, ſo none of theſe can ſtand either with diuinity or philoſophy; either with faith or reaſon: either with Scripture or nature: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore th ſe pillars being remoued, this tower of <hi>Babell,</hi> I mean the doctrine of tranſubſtantiation, muſt of neceſsity fall to the ground. The 18. reaſon: If the Diſciples had not vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood Chriſt to cal the bread his body ſacramentally: they would haue bin greatly troubled (who ofte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> doubted of the leaſt things) &amp; demanded the vnderſtanding of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. As the hearers of Chriſt <hi>I h.</hi> 6. ſuppoſing he had ſpoken of a carnall manner of eating his<note n="e" place="margin">Ioh. 6, 52, 60</note> fleſh, were troubled and offended, ſaying, <hi>How can this man giue vs his fleſh to eate?</hi> And ver. 60. <hi>This is an hard ſaying, who can heare <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>t?</hi> Wherfore, who ſeeth not that they would haue maruelled and required farther, if they had vnderſtood Chriſt to haue changed the bread in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his body, and the wine into his blood? But they doubt not, they demand not, they maruell not, they murmure not, &amp; therefore beleeue not this iugling of tranſubſtantiation or turning of one ſubſtance into another. And if they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeued
<pb n="362" facs="tcp:21092:198"/> it not, how ſhould we receiue it? If they receiued it not, how ſhould we beleeue it?</p>
               <p>The 19. argument: It ouerturneth ſundry Articles of ou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> Chriſtian faith. We beleeue that Chriſt Ieſus was begot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten of the Father before al worlds, and borne in time of the <hi>Virgin Mary:</hi> this the Scripture teacheth, this the Creed de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuereth: this euery true Chriſtian profeſſeth &amp; beleeueth. But if the bread bee tranſubſtantiated into the bodye of Chriſt, and the wine into the blood of Chriſt: then his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy is made and borne of bread and wine, and the Prieſt af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the words of conſecration may ſay, a little pretty ſon is borne vnto vs, and newly made. Wherefore, in the <hi>Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal</hi> of <hi>Sarum</hi> after that the Prieſt hath conſecrated, hee ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth a low leg, worſhipping the worke of his owne hands, and ſaith, <hi>Aue:</hi> which is as much as God ſaue you Sir; or, you are welcome to towne.</p>
               <p>Againe, we beleeue that Chriſt was crucified and dyed for our ſinnes, that he was buried, roſe againe, aſcended, &amp; ſitteth at the right hand of God the Father almighty. But if the body of Chriſt be made of bread as often as the <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chariſt</hi> is celebrated, then Chriſt being on the Croſſe might be elſewhere then on the Croſſe: when he dyed, he might be where he ſuffered nothing: lying in the graue, he might be out of the graue: yea he might be in the graue after his reſurrection and riſing out of the graue: wherof notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding the Angels ſaid,<note n="f" place="margin">Mat 28, 5.</note> 
                  <hi>he is not heere.</hi> Laſtly, wee be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue that Chriſt ſhal come from heauen to iudge the quick and dead, and that in the ſame manner he aſcended,<note n="g" place="margin">Reuel. 1, 7.</note> who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> we doubt not but men ſhall ſee, as Reuel. 1.7. <hi>Euery eye ſhall ſee him, yea euen they which pierced him through.</hi> But if Chriſts body be made of bread, he ſhall ſtare and ſtart out of the pixe, and not come from heauen, and that in another ſhape then when he aſcended: nay thus he ſhould come daily vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to vs, and yet no man can ſee him, nor perceiue his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming. All theſe deuices ouerthrow the foundation of faith, ſauour of nouelty, and bring in hereſie againſt all cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine grounds of true religion.</p>
               <p>The 20, argument: If by vertue of Chriſts words, tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſubſtantiation
<pb n="363" facs="tcp:21092:198"/> were brought to paſſe, and the true bodye of Chriſt were really preſent on the earth: then the bread ſhould be changed into whole Chriſt, that is, into his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy indued with his magnitude, quantity, quality, colour, &amp; all his dimenſions. For Chriſt ſaid not at his Supper, this is the ſubſtance of my body without accidents: but<note n="h" place="margin">Luk. 21.16. 1 Cor. 11, 24.</note> 
                  <hi>This is my body wh ch is giuen for you, and which is broken for you.</hi> Therefore the body was viſible and ſeene of them al it was felt, it had all accidents agreeable thereunto, and the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of Chriſts body alone without his qualities was not crucified on the Croſſe, neither yet could be crucified. Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding, we ſee not Chriſts body vpon the earth, nor any adioynt thereof is perceiued or diſcerned. Where are they then? Are they in the ſubſtance of Chriſts body which is in heauen? And not in the ſubſtance of his body which is on the earth? Then they make Chriſt to haue two diſtinct bodies: for one and the ſame body cannot haue his properties and dimenſions, and yet be without them, which neceſſarily implyeth a contradiction, &amp; conſequently falſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood: eſpecially conſidering how great a difference they make betweene the body of Chriſt in heauen, and this bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy that lyeth and lurketh vnder the accidents and ſhewes of bread in their boxe.</p>
               <p>The 21. reaſon: It deſtroyeth the nature of a true body, it taketh away the defence vſed againſt hereticks, &amp; bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth in the hereſies of <hi>Marcion,</hi> of <hi>Eutyches,</hi> and the <hi>Mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chies,</hi> which<note n="i" place="margin">Auguſt. ad Quod vult de.</note> denyed Chriſt to haue a ſolid, and true hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane body, and held that he had onely a phantaſticall bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy without any materiall fleſh, blood, or bone, in appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance and ſight ſomewhat, but in deed and ſubſtance no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing. For they teach that his body is in infinite places at once, and thoſe diſcontinued, void of quantity and qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, not circumſcribed, not viſible, nor any way ſenſible: that being in heauen, he is really and corporally on earth, though not in the diſtance betweene heauen and earth, nor in thoſe places where the hoſt is not: which is to aſsigne innumerable bodies to our Sauiour Chriſt, and conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to make him no body, which is in effect as much as to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny

               <p>The 24. reaſon: the Apoſtle maketh an oppoſition be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene the table of the Lord, and the table of Diuels, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,<note n="r" place="margin">1 Cor. 10, 20.21.</note> 
                  <hi>Ye cannot drinke the cup of the Lord, and the cup of diuels: ye cannot be partakers of the Lords table, and of the table of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uels:</hi> where he ſheweth, that to eate the fleſh offered vnto Idols is to be partakers of the Idols, as the bread which we breake, is the participation and communion of the body of the Lord.

If then the fleſh offered to Idols be not tranſubſtantiated: why ſhould the ſacramentall bread be turned into the body of Chriſt, ſeeing it ſufficeth to make vs partakers of the Lords body, to eat of the bread; as it was ſufficient to make them partakers of the Idols, to eate of the things offered vnto them?</p>
               <p>The 25. reaſon: If the inſtitution of Chriſt be a ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent direction vnto the Church what to hold in this queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, we ſhall eaſily giue this tranſubſtantiation a fall. Wee ſee in the caſes of matrimony that did befall, our Sauiour bringeth them to the firſt inſtitution, and thereby diſſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth the doubts and difficulties that aroſe, ſaying,<note n="ſ" place="margin">Mat 19, 3. 4, 8.</note> 
                  <hi>From the beginning it was not ſo.</hi> So when any controuerſie ariſeth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the Lords Supper, the ordinance of Chriſt is able to take it vp, how great or grieuous ſoeuer it grow. Now there is no ſentence, no word, no ſillable, no iot, no title in the deſcription of the Supper, that fauoureth or ſauou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth of tranſubſtantiation, or ſignifieth and inſinuateth any ſuch matter. True it is, Chriſt ſaith,<note n="t" place="margin">Mat. 26, 26.</note> 
                  <hi>This is my body,</hi> but
<pb n="366" facs="tcp:21092:200"/> to be, doth not ſignifie to tranſubſtantiate: for then when he ſaith,<note n="u" place="margin">Ioh. 15 1. &amp; 10, 7. &amp; 14, 6.</note> 
                  <hi>I am the true vine, I am the doore, the way,</hi> and ſuch like, he ſhall be turned and tranſubſtantiated into a natural vine, into a materiall doore into an high way, from whence would follow infinite abuſe; and abſurdities. Beſides, if the word <hi>(is)</hi> in the inſtitution ſignifie, is tranſubſtantiated, that is, changed from one ſubſtance into another, from bread into fleſh, from wine into blood: then the change ſhould be made before all the words be vttered, ſo that hence it wold follow, that it cannot be done by vertue of the words, which goeth before the pronouncing of the words.</p>
               <p>Laſt of all, the maintainers of tranſubſtantiation, as the builders of <hi>Babell,</hi> haue their tongues diuided, and their languages confounded: they cannot accord together, but vary and diſſent one from another,<note n="a" place="margin">Mar. 14, 56.</note> like the falſe witneſſes that aroſe againſt Chriſt.

Thirdly, they know not what is broke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, whether bread, or accidents, or nothing: others ſay, the true body of Chriſt is broken. Fourthly, they agree not, whether their water in the chalice mingled with wine, bee tranſubſtantiated: ſome ſay it is, other ſay it is not: ſome more ſober then the reſt, are afraid what to ſay,<note n="d" place="margin">Durand. li. <hi>4.</hi>
                  </note> and aske who is able to decide the queſtion? Others ſay it is turned into the humors of his body: others vnknit the knot thus, that the water is turned into the wine, &amp; then the wine into his blood, and therefore are circumſpect to giue this cautel that a little water be mingled, being afraid leaſt if more wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter were put in then, the wine, the wine ſhould be tranſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantiated into water. Fiftly, they cannot agree with what words their conſecration is wrought, whether accidents be without their ſubiect, whether the accide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts nouriſh no leſſe then the ſubſtance of bread and wine: likewiſe what the rats and mice do eate: how and from whence the wormes
<pb n="367" facs="tcp:21092:200"/> are oftentimes ingendered in their <hi>Euchariſt,</hi> &amp; ſo conſume it: whether the ſhewes of bread be the body without the blood, &amp; the ſhewes of wine the blood without the body. Sixtly, ſoone after the Apoſtles had receiued the Supper in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to their ſtomackes,<note place="margin">Luk. 22, 44.</note> Chriſt Ieſus did ſweate great drops of blood trickling downe to the ground, and was afterward buffetted, mocked, ſpit vpon, and crucified. Now they dare not ſay that this body of Ieſus ſo ſpitefully and contume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liouſly intreated, ſwet any drops of blood in the ſtomacks of the Apoſtles, or was by the Souldiors apprehended and buffetted vnder the formes of bread and wine, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they make at one &amp; the ſame time a double Chriſt; one Chriſt ſuffering in the garden and on the Croſſe: another not ſuffering in the Diſciples: one Chriſt apprehended, and another not apprehended: one Chriſt ſweating, another not ſweating; one Chriſt buffetted by the Souldiors, and another not buffetted. Seauenthly, they confeſſe that Chriſt both adminiſtred and participated of this Sacrament with his Apoſtles, whereof will follow that Chriſt did eate himſelfe and did drinke himſelfe: and ſeeing they hold his body is in the cuppe, they muſt alſo hold that hee did drinke his owne body. From whence ariſeth a flat and expreſſe contradiction: for to ſay that the body of Chriſt was all whole in his ſtomacke, is to affirme that that which is within, containeth that which is without, as if the ſcab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berd were in the ſword, or the cup in the wine, or the purſe in the mony. Thus they make the outward part to bee within the inner, and without the inner, that is, without and not without: yea, whereas they affirme that the body of our Lord is greater then the formes of bread which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine it, they make that which is contained greater then that which doth containe it, that is, the treaſure wider and larger then the casket in which it is locked: contrary to al the rules of reaſon, the principles of nature, and the maxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes of the Mathematicks. Eightly, they ſay, that the body of Chriſt is all whole in heauen, and all whole in the pixe, and yet they renounce the Vbiquity of his bodye, and holde that hee is not in place betwixt both,
<pb n="368" facs="tcp:21092:201"/> ſo that they make a diſtance betweene the body of Chriſt, and the body of Chriſt; and therefore withall they make him lower then himſelfe and higher then himſelfe, and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated from himſelfe. Ninthly, they teach that the body of Chriſt in the Maſſe, hath all the dimenſions and parts of an humane body diſtinct in their naturall ſcituation: and yet they teach, that there is not ſo ſmall a piece of the hoſt where that body is not whole, ſo that his head ſhall bee where his feet are, and his feet where his head is. And tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching his blood, they ſay it is ſhed in the Maſſe, and yet notwithſtanding they call it an vnbloody ſacrifice, ſo that by their reckoning, there is blood not bloody, and a ſhed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of blood not bloody; as if a man ſhould ſay, white<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe which is not white, heate which is not hot, or cold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe which is not cold. Thus they had rather ſay and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſay, and be at diſcord with themſelues, then to accord with vs and the truth. They thinke it reaſon to deny all rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, &amp; a ſenceleſſe thing to be iudged by the ſenſes. Theſe ope<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> and euident contradictions ſo ſtifly auouched &amp; ſtout<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly defended, that an humane body ſhould fill no place, and yet ſhould be in an hundred thouſand diuers places, haue length without being extended, &amp; be whole in euery crum of the bread, are ſo groſſe and palpable abſurdities, that they do eſtrange the <hi>Turkes</hi> and Infidels from imbracing the Chriſtian religion.<note place="margin">Auerrhoes.</note> It is noted of an <hi>Arabian Spaniard</hi> writing vpon the 12. booke of the Metaphyſickes, that his <hi>ſoule ſhould hold with the Philoſophers, ſince the Chriſtians wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip that which they eate.</hi> The <hi>Pagans</hi> mocke at this as a bru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſh conceite,<note place="margin">Cicer. de nat.

                  </note> to note out all their contentions and

And thus much of the late doting de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice of tranſubſtantiation, which is the ſoule &amp; life of their popiſh religion: the denyers or doubters wherof, they pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue with fire and ſword more eagerly, then ſuch as are ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies to the bleſſed Trinity.</p>
               <p>The laſt generall vſe is this: If Chriſt deliuered both theſe ſignes, not onely the bread, but the wine alſo to his Diſciples: then both kinds by the Miniſter are to be deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,<note n="f" place="margin">Chriſts peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple muſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue the ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per vnder both kinds.</note> and both kinds by the people are to be receiued, not bread alone, nor wine alone, but bread and wine: the bread in token of his body giuen for vs, and the wine in token of his blood ſhed for vs. This is the ordinance of Chriſt: this is agreeable to the Scripture. Notwithſtanding, the church of <hi>Rome</hi> hath decreed, that it is not neceſſary for the people to communicate in both kinds, &amp; holdeth them<note n="g" place="margin">Con. Trident. ſeſſ. <hi>21,</hi> cap. <hi>2.</hi>
                  </note> accurſed that hold it neceſſary for the people to receiue the cup, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecrated by the Prieſt. Thus it appeareth they labor nothing more, then to take from the faithfull the ſweet comfort of the Lords Supper. This is a ſacrilegious corruptio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of Chriſts inſtitution, deuiſed by Sathan, broached by Antichriſt, pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed by his adherents in the corrupt times of moſt palpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble darkneſſe, as may appeare by theſe reaſons.</p>
               <p>Firſt, if none may drinke of the conſecrate wine but the Prieſts, then none ſhould eate of the bread but Prieſts: ſo that they muſt either exclude the people from both, which I truſt they dare not; or admit them to both, which as yet they do not. For to whom Chriſt ſaid,<note n="h" place="margin">Mat. 26, 26.27.</note> 
                  <hi>Take and eate,</hi> to thoſe gaue he the cup and ſaid, <hi>Drinke ye.</hi> Wherefore, the ſignes being both equall, all communicants muſt drinke of the one, as well as eate of the other, there being the ſame warrant for the one, that there is for the other, and the let that would barre the one, will hinder the other: ſo as<note n="i" place="margin">Mat. 19, 6.</note> the things which God in his goodneſſe hath ioyned together, man without ſinne cannot ſeparate.</p>
               <p>Secondly, when Chriſt inſtituted this Sacrament, he ſaid,<note n="k" place="margin">Mat. 26, 27. Mar. 14, 23. 1 Cor. 12, 13.</note> 
                  <hi>Drinke ye all of this:</hi> and by all he vnderſtood al the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municants.
<pb n="370" facs="tcp:21092:202"/> And the Euangeliſt <hi>Marke</hi> addeth, <hi>They al drank of it,</hi> to wit, all that were preſent at his laſt Supper, who had before eaten of the bread of the Lord. This alſo appeareth by the Apoſtle, 1 Cor. 12. <hi>They haue beene all made to drinke into one Spirit.</hi> This commandement of Chriſt being gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall, impoſeth a neceſsity vpon the people, when hee ſaith, <hi>Take ye, eate ye, drinke ye, doe ye this.</hi> Theſe commandements are perpetuall, vnchangeable, and alwayes in force: not ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitrary, not temporall, not repealed, but binde the conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to the end of the world, againſt which no limitation, or diſpenſation can be allowed, being the commandeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts<note n="l" place="margin">1 Cor. 14, 37</note> of God, not of man.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, the cup is a part of Chriſts will and teſtament. Now touching the nature of a teſtament or will, the ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Apoſtle is knowne,<note n="m" place="margin">Gal. 3, 15. Heb. 9, 16, 17.</note> 
                  <hi>If it be but a mans teſtament, when it is confirmed, no man doth abrogate it, or addeth any thing thereto:</hi> where he ſheweth, that the dead mans will may not be changed, nothing can be put too, nothing taken out without forgery and falſhood. This is the law of nature and Nations. But the Lords Supper is a Sacrament proper to the new Teſtament, as Chriſt ſaith,<note n="n" place="margin">Luk, 22, 20.</note> 
                  <hi>This cuppe is the new Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament in my blood which is ſhed for you.</hi> This teſtament the Lord Ieſus made the night before he was betrayed, he ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led it by ſhedding his moſt precious blood, hee hath giuen legacies, not of earthly and temporall, but of heauenly and eternall goods. And ſeeing he hath appointed the cup of this his teſtament to be deliuered and drunke of al thoſe for whom his blood was ſhed: it is intollerable boldnes and preſumption to take away the vſe thereof from the greater part of the Church, and an infallible token of an vnſhame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faſt and ſhameleſſe harlot, to alter her husbands wil, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraud and defeat his children of that worthy portion which their father allotted them, and ſo to keepe backe part of their inheritance and poſſeſsion.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, the blood of Chriſt ſhed vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Croſſe belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not only to the Paſtors and teachers, but to al the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full that come to the table of the Lord, as appeareth by the words of Chriſt,<note n="o" place="margin">Mat. 26, 28. Luk. 22, 20.</note> 
                  <hi>This is my blood which is ſhed for you and for
<pb n="371" facs="tcp:21092:202" rendition="simple:additions"/> many:</hi> why then ſhould the blood of Chriſt be denyed, or the cup of the Lord be barred from the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>? If then the blood of Chriſt were ſhed for the people, as well as for the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters: ſurely the cup belongeth to one as well as to the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. If the people haue the greater, who ſhal keep the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> from the leſſe? If they haue their part in the thing ſignified, who ſhall deny them of the outward ſigne? For as the fruite and effect of the blood of Chriſt is common to the people with the Paſtor: ſo ſhould the cup alſo, which is the communion of his blood ſhed for the redemption of the peoples ſins, be diuided indifferently betweene the Paſtor and the people.</p>
               <p>Fiftly, the<note n="p" place="margin">1 Cor. 11, 23</note> Apoſtle deliuered that to the church which he had receiued from the Lords Ieſus: Now the church ought diligently to obſerue the written traditions and verities of the Apoſtles, which are committed to poſterity to be kept inuiolably. But he hath deliuered, how the Lord after ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king, bleſsing, breaking, and diſtributing of the bread, like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe tooke the cup, bleſſed, and diſtributed it among them, ſo ſaith the Apoſtle muſt the churches do. If then he recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued this from the Lord, to deluer both kinds to the people; let the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> conſider with her ſelfe, fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> whence ſhe hath receiued the contrary, to with-hold one of the kinds from the people: for both ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not proceed from one &amp; the ſame ſpirit of truth, which is neuer contrary to it ſelfe.</p>
               <p>Sixtly, if all the faithfull that come to the Lords Table, muſt ſhew forth the Lords death vntill he come, and this be done by them as wel by drinking of the cup, as by eating of the bread: then all the communicants muſt receiue the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament vnder both kinds,<note n="q" place="margin">1 Cor. 11, 26</note> vntill the ſecond comming of Chriſt. But the faithful muſt ſhew forth the Lords death by eating of that bread &amp; drinking of that cup, as the Apoſtle teacheth, <hi>As often as ye ſhall eate this bread, and drinke of this cup, ye ſhew the Lords death vntill he come.</hi> Therefore, all com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municants muſt partake the Sacrament vnder both kinds.</p>
               <p>Seuenthly, the Apoſtle giueth an expreſſe commandement to the whole church, which all muſt obey that come wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thily to this holy table, <hi>Let a man examine himſelfe,</hi>
                  <note n="r" place="margin">1 Cor. 11, 2<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>.</note> 
                  <hi>and ſo let him eate of this bread, &amp; drinke of this cup.</hi> Where he giueth
<pb n="372" facs="tcp:21092:203"/> a double commandement, firſt to prepare reuerently, then to receiue worthily. Now al that muſt proue and try them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, are commanded not only to eate bread, but to drinke of the cup: but al muſt try and examine themſelues: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore all are commanded both to eate &amp; drinke at the Lords table. If this be a commandement to examine: then the words following of eating and drinking, are likewiſe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements. There is no haulting in theſe, let them admit both, or let them deny both.</p>
               <p>Eightly, if the faithfull take not the cup in the Supper of the Lord, the condition of Chriſtians vnder the Goſpell, ſhall be worſe then of the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> vnder the law. For the people of <hi>Iſrael</hi> in the wilderneſſe hauing the ſame Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in effect with vs,<note n="ſ" place="margin">1 Cor. 10, 4.</note> 
                  <hi>Did all drink of the ſpiritual rocke that followed them, and that rocke was Chriſt,</hi> as the Apoſtle affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth. But our condition is not worſer &amp; weaker the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> theirs: therfore al the faithful are to drinke of the cup of the Lord. <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> the Souldan of the Romiſh Synagogue,<note n="t" place="margin">Bellar. lib. <hi>4.</hi> de Eucha ca. <hi>27</hi>
                  </note> anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth thus, <hi>They drunke not water out of the rocke when they did eat of the ſpirituall meat, but in another place &amp; at another time.</hi> But this is an anſwereleſſe anſwere which cannot ſatisfie. For albeit the Sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts of the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> as figures &amp; types did repreſent, the ſame graces that our Sacraments do: yet it is not neceſſary they ſhould in all points anſwere each o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and in all reſpects agree together. Beſides, the church of <hi>Rome</hi> at no time alloweth the people to drinke of the Wine, a ſeale of the blood of Chriſt: they keepe them from the cup of the Lord, both when they giue them the bread, and at all other times, and thereby make their eſtate worſer then the eſtate of the <hi>Iewes.</hi> Indeed, if they did at a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny time permit al the people to drink of the cup, they might pretend this example of the <hi>Iſraelites:</hi> but inaſmuch as they vtterly deny them this part of the cup, they ouerthrow the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues in their malice, and yet in their blindnes they do not ſee it. Finally, many of the Fathers did both eate <hi>Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na,</hi> and drinke water out of the Rocke, if not in the ſame place, yet at one and the ſame time,<note n="n" place="margin">Exod. 16, 21</note> inaſmuch as they gathered thereof euery morning, and it ceaſed not<note n="a" place="margin">Ioſh. 5, 12.</note> vntill
<pb n="373" facs="tcp:21092:203"/> they entred the frontiers and confines of the land of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe. But they neuer allow without a tolleration and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſation, the people in any place, at any time, vpon any oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion, and in any reſpect, to taſte of the cup in the Lords Supper.</p>
               <p>Ninthly, if the cup of the new teſtament may bee taken from the Lords people: in like manner the water in bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme may be taken away from the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. For the blood of Chriſt, whereby remiſsion of ſins is purchaſed and procured, is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented by the wine of the Lords Supper, as well as by the water in baptiſme. But the water in baptiſme without great ſacriledge, cannot be omitted or neglected: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore then ſhould the cup be taken away.</p>
               <p>Tenthly, in the matter of the Supper our aduerſaries al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge the words of Chriſt in <hi>Iohn,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Iohn 6.</note> 
                  <hi>If you drinke not my blood, you ſhall haue no life in you.</hi> If theſe words be thus to be vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood, then by depriuing them of the cup, they depriue the people of life and ſaluation.</p>
               <p>Againe, if drinking of the chalice be a priuiledge of the Clergy, how commeth it to paſſe that Kings and Princes haue a part in this priuiledge? How is it that they are per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted as well to drinke of the conſecrated wine, as to eate of the conſecrated bread? But heerein was a notable piece of cunning &amp; a great point of policy vſed, partly to adua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce the dignity of the Clergy, and partly to ſtop the mouthes of Princes. For as by this order or rather diſorder, the proud Clergy are made companions with Kings and Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, euen equall vnto them, ſo they thinke to hood-winke them &amp; make them content to ſwallow the reſt of their ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtitions, becauſe they are pleaſed to grace the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> with this priuiledge aboue the people as with a ſpeciall fauour.</p>
               <p>Moreouer, it is not to be omitted, that a principall end of this Sacrament was inſtituted to ſet foorth the death of Chriſt, not onely as an idle narration, but as a profitable application thereof to the conſcience. How then ſhall the people know that the fruite of ſhedding his preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous blood belongeth vnto them as the nouriſhment of their ſoules, except beſides the looking vpon the cuppe,
<pb n="374" facs="tcp:21092:204"/> they be partakers of it? It is therefore neceſſary to vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand by eating and drinking, that God doth not nouriſh them by halfes, but that Chriſt yeeldeth whole nouriſhme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t vnto them. Such then are worthily taxed of raſhnes them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues that complaine how the people raſhly preſume to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue the Sacrament vnder both kindes: for as well they might ſay, that it is raſhneſſe and preſumption to imitate and follow Chriſt. And they may iuſtly be condemned of hereſie, who pronounce them hereticks and worthy to be puniſhed by the ſecular power, that ſpeake againſt recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing in one kind onely; as if it were hereſie to follow the example of Chriſt left to the Church. For what remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth more but to proceed one degree farther, euen to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce Chriſt himſelfe an Arch-heretick, and all the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles hereticks alſo, and to condemne them to the Inquiſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion as deceiuers and impoſtors ſeducing and miſleading the people?</p>
               <p>Laſtly, if any part of the Supper might be taken away from the people: then likewiſe the word of God may bee taken from them, for in this point there is the ſame reaſon and reſpect of them both. A Sacrament is nothing elſe but a viſible word, and a ſealing vp of the word: and the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence ſeemeth to be the ſame, whether a man breake the ſeale, or rent the writing. But the word cannot be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawne from Chriſtian people, it being the inſtrument of faith, and the life of the Church. Wherefore it is the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt wrong and iniury done to the people of God to take from them the cup of ſaluation. The anſwere to this rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon muſt be, to confeſſe the parts and yeeld the concluſion; foraſmuch as by forbidding the people the reading of the ſcriptures, they haue robbed them of the word of God, and taken from them<note n="b" place="margin">Luk. 11, 52.</note> the key of knowledge, neither entring themſelues into the kingdome of heauen, nor ſuffering thoſe that would enter. No maruaile then, if they take the cup of bleſsing from the people, who haue taken from them the free vſe of the word of God. To conclude theſe reaſons<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> it is Antichriſt, who contrary to the doctrine of Chriſt, contrary to the inſtitution of the Supper, contrary
<pb n="375" facs="tcp:21092:204"/> to the practiſe of the Apoſtles, and contrary to the vſe of the former churches, hath excluded the people languiſhing and thirſting after the blood of Chriſt, as the dry earth for the ſweet ſhowers of raine, fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> taking the cup of the Lord, and left them a dry communion to eate the bread of the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament alone. Hauing conſidered the truth of God by ſundry reaſons grounded in the Scripture, that the people haue good intereſt and title in the cup denyed vnto them: let vs anſwere the<note n="c" place="margin">Obiections for taking <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Firſt, they pretend that Chriſt adminiſtred it to the apoſtles onely, and not to any of the people: and conſequently the inſtitution, for taking the cup can be no generall comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement for al men: thus<note n="d" place="margin">

I anſwere, firſt it may bee doubted and diſputed, whether onely the Apoſtles were preſent at his laſt Supper. For ſeeing diuers were added vnto the Church, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed the faith of Chriſt, ſeeing he had other Diſciples be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide the twelue, ſeeing many godly men and women follo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wed him to ſee his miracles<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> &amp; to heare the gracious words that proceeded out of his mouth: why ſhould wee thinke that none of them were admitted to his table, who had of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten heard his preaching<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and depended vpon him in their li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing. Againe, the Paſſeouer was celebrated in the houſe<note n="e" place="margin">Mat 26, 17.18.</note> of a faithfull man, as may be collected by ſundry circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances: now then, either the Lord Ieſus annexed that fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly vnto his, as the law in one caſe appointed; or elſe we ſhall haue two Paſſeouers at one time in one houſe, which hath no warrant of Scripture, no colour of truth, no probabili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of reaſon.

Why then ſhould wee not think that Chriſt added &amp; annexed other to his family, ſeeing his owne diſciples ſufficed not, eſpecially the bleſſed Virgin his mother who was not long from him?<note n="n" place="margin">Ioh. 19, 26.27.</note> whom af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward, after his departure, he commended and committed to <hi>Iohn,</hi> to be protected and prouided for, who from that time tooke her home to his houſe as his owne mother. To conclude, we muſt conſider, that beſides the lambe killed for the Paſſeouer, (whereby they were not all ſatisfied) they had other meate to make vp their Supper, as appeareth by the broth wherein the ſoppe was dipped, Math. 26, 23. Mark. 14, 20. Iohn 13, 26. For the Lambe commanded by the ordinance of God to bee roaſted, had no ſauce or broth appointed, but onely ſowre hearbes preſcribed, Exodus 12. So ther,<note place="margin">Fulk on Mat. <hi>16.</hi>
                  </note> the learned obſerue that there were three Suppets that night: the firſt of the Pafchall Lambe, of which the Euangeliſts ſay, <hi>The Paſſeouer was prepared.</hi> The ſecond was an ordinary ſupper to feed and nouriſh the body, ſuch as was daily receiued, whereunto wee muſt referre <hi>the dip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping of the ſoppe in the platter,</hi> inaſmuch as the Paſſeouer had no ſuch ordinance. The third was after both the other,
<pb n="377" facs="tcp:21092:205"/> to wit, the Sacrament of the Lords Supper inſtituted to feed the ſoule, and therefore was taken after the body was fedde. Moreouer, when the Diſciples were ſent to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare a place to eate the Paſſeouer, the man whom they met bearing a pitcher of water ſhewed them <hi>a large vpper roome furniſhed and prepared:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Mar. 14.15.</note> now what need had there beene of ſuch a large chamber, if twelue gueſts onely had ſate there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in? Wherefore albeit we confeſſe according to the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, that he ſate downe with the twelue, yet it followeth not heereupon that the twelue onely were preſent, but that all the twelue were preſent at the Paſſeouer. It was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed prepared and prouided for the Diſciples, Mathew 26. 18. Luke 22.11. but he had moe Diſciples then they, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeuing in his name, and profeſsing the truth that they had learned of him; and are oftentimes diſtinguiſhed from the twelue, which he called his Apoſtles.<note place="margin">Ioh. 6, 66, 67.</note>
               </p>
               <p>But to leaue theſe conſiderations as coniectures, wee anſwere the former obiection, that inaſmuch as Chriſt deliuered both ſignes to the ſame perſons, they might bar the people from the bread as well as from the cuppe. For I would know why the bread is neceſſary, but becauſe it was inſtituted by Chriſt, and retained by his Apoſtles? Wherefore, the inſtitution maketh the one as requiſite as the other. Beſides, if other hereticks ſhould ariſe, as great enemies to the peoples partaking of the bread, as the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> is to their communicating of the cuppe of the Lord: how might they better be repreſſed and refel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, then by alledging the firſt inſtitution of Chriſt, and ſhewing the practiſe of the Apoſtles? So that the reaſons broght to confute the one, will ſerue directly to ouerthrow the other.</p>
               <p>Moreouer, the Diſciples at the firſt miniſtration of the Supper, performed not the office of the Miniſter, nor any part of his duty, but of the people; Chriſt was the Miniſter thereof, he tooke the bread he bleſſed, he gaue the bread, ſaying, <hi>This is my body.</hi> Likewiſe hee tooke the cup, bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, and gaue the ſame, ſaying, <hi>This cup is the new teſtament in my blood.</hi> On the other ſide, the Diſciples tooke it, did
<pb n="378" facs="tcp:21092:206"/> eate and drinke, which are the proper duties of all the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. Laſtly, the Apoſtle ſaith not in the firſt perſon, we eate and drinke, as ſpeaking of himſelfe and other teachers of the Church: but directing his ſpeech to al<note n="o" place="margin">1 Cor. 1, 2.</note> that are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led and ſanctified in Chriſt in euery place, (according to the inſcription of the epiſtle) he ſaith, <hi>As often as ye ſhall eate this bread</hi>
                  <note n="p" place="margin">1 Cor. 11, 26</note> 
                  <hi>and drinke this cup, ye ſhew the Lords death till he come.</hi> Now theſe <hi>Corinthians</hi> to whom he eſpecially wrote, could not liue vntil the ſecond comming of Chriſt to iudgement: therefore this eating &amp; this drinking belongeth to vs that liue in theſe daies, and to all that cal vpon the name of God to the end of the world.</p>

                  </label> by a common Synecdoche, one part is put for the whole.

<pb n="379" facs="tcp:21092:206"/> the other, and by one part the whole. Furthermore, it is a ruled caſe among themſelues, that it is flat ſacriledge, if a Prieſt conſecrate not this Sacrament in both kindes, but do it in bread onely. If then the former Scriptures, Act. 2. and chap, 20. proue the receiuing vnder one kinde, becauſe bread onely is expreſſed, and ſo the cup to bee excluded: it will likewiſe follow, they conſecrated in one kinde, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the wine is not expreſſed: and therefore by theſe pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, neither Prieſt nor people ſhould take the cup, if they will not admit a trope or figure. Neither can they ſay, that <hi>Luke</hi> deſcribeth not what the Apoſtles conſecrated or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued, but what they deliuered to the people: for the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uangeliſt declareth, Acts 20, 11. not onely that the Apoſtle brake the bread but<note n="t" place="margin">Act. 20, 7.</note> did eate there of himſelfe; ſo that they muſt confeſſe, that <hi>Paul</hi> alſo receiued in one kinde, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecrated in one kinde, or elſe neceſſarily grant one part put for the whole: as likewiſe we ſee, 1 Cor. 11. where he doth expreſly touch and teach both kindes,<note n="u" place="margin">1 Cor. 11, 26 27, 28, 29.</note> to the eating of the bread ioyning the drinking of this cup: yet ſometimes<note n="a" place="margin">1 Cor. 11.20, 29, 33.</note> he expreſſeth onely the one ſigne for ſhortneſſe ſake; and the Church had receiued this vſuall manner of ſpeaking, to call the Lords Supper the breaking of bread, as verſe 20. <hi>When ye come together into one place, this is not to eate the Lords Supper:</hi> and verſe 33. <hi>When ye come together to eate, tarry one for another:</hi> likewiſe verſe 29 <hi>He diſcerneth not the Lords bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy:</hi> and yet in the ſentence going before, he ſaith that ſuch as eate and drinke vnworthily, doe eate and drinke their owne iudgement. Wherefore, as the Apoſtles alwayes celebrated the Supper by conſecration both of the bread and of the cuppe: ſo the people alwaies receiued in both theſe ki<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>des, to their great comfort and conſolation.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, they pretend that Chriſt our Sauiour did eate <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Obiection </seg>3</label> with the two Diſciples at <hi>Emaus,</hi> Luk. 24.30. where it is onely ſaid, <hi>Ieſus tooke bread, and when he had giuen thanks, he brake it:</hi> Howbeit heere is no ſpeech of the cup at all, of ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king it into his hands, and deliuering it into their hands.

                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Anſwere. </seg>
                  </label> that the Euangeliſt ſpeaketh not of the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in this place, but of their ordinary repaſt for the ſuſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance
<pb n="380" facs="tcp:21092:207"/> of the body. Secondly, ſuppoſe and admit that Chriſt had there adminiſtred the holy Supper, becauſe here is mention made of taking, and bleſsing, and breaking, and giuing of bread: yet it will not follow by any good con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequent, that there was no wine at all, becauſe <hi>Luke</hi> ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth of bread onely; for it is ſaid in like manner that <hi>Ioſeph,</hi> made Gouernour of the land of <hi>Egypt,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Gen. 43, 25. and 37, 25. Mat. 14, 19. Luk. 9, 16.</note> inuited his brethren <hi>to eate bread:</hi> the meaning is not that they were bidden to a dry feaſt and dranke not at it, but one part is put for the whole nouriſhment. So are the words to be vnderſtood in this place, that they did eate &amp; drinke together, hauing communed and trauelled together. If any man remaine obſtinate and will not be ſatisfied with theſe things, but aske further, how it will appeare that there was more then bread vſed among them, I referre him to the words of <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> preaching to <hi>Cornelius,</hi> Acts 10.<note place="margin">Act. 10 40.41.</note> where ſpeaking of Chriſt he ſaith, <hi>Him God raiſed vp the third day, and ſhewed him openly, not to al the people, but vnto vs witneſſes choſen before of God, euen to vs that did eate and drinke with him after he roſe fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the dead.</hi> In which words the truth of his reſurrection is proued, by performing of ſuch actions as were ordinary &amp; familiar: and albeit he be ſaid, not once or twice, but of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentimes to eate with them, Ioh. 21, 13.

If they thinke ſo, let them tell vs plainely: if not, let them lay their hands vpon their mouth, and ſubmit themſelues vnto him who adminiſtred it in both kinds, and commanded his Apoſtles to doe the like.

Trid. ſeſſ. <hi>3.</hi> can. <hi>3.</hi>
                  </note> vnion of the bodye with the blood, and blood with the body, flatly croſſeth and ouerthroweth the inſtitution of Chriſt. And why I pray you do their ſacrificing Prieſtes receiue the blood twice, and the body twice, drinking firſt the blood in the body, and againe eating the body in the blood? Nay, doth not this vnion deuiſed, alter the inſtitution of Chriſt, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found the ſeuerall parts of it, making him to ſpeake other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe then the Euangeliſts expreſſe? For when hee ſaide,
<pb n="382" facs="tcp:21092:208"/> 
                  <hi>This is my body,</hi> they will haue him meane, this is my body and blood: Againe; when he ſaid, <hi>this is my blood,</hi> they will haue him meane, this is my blood and my body. Laſt of all, this late inuention, turneth and ouerturneth the nature of the parts, diſtinguiſhed one from the other: while wee eate the fleſh they make vs drinke the blood, and while we drinke the blood, they imagine we eate the body. Thus to eate and to drinke ſhall be all one with them: for we ſhall eate liquid and moiſt things, and we ſhall drinke dry and hard things. And is not this drinking of fleſh, and eating of blood, an inuerting &amp; euerting of the nature of things? But thus God ſtriketh his enemies with giddineſſe of ſpirit. For after they haue broken the pure inſtitution of Chriſt, and brought in a carnall preſence of his body, (one abſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity being granted,<note n="k" place="margin">Ariſt. phyſ. lib. <hi>1.</hi> cap. <hi>2.</hi> &amp; <hi>3.</hi>
                  </note> a thouſand follow) infinite abuſes haue enſued vpon heapes, the flood-gates being ſet open, whereof there is no end or meaſure. Let them therefore repent themſelues of this ſacriledge againſt God, and iniu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry againſt his people, reſtoring vnto them the communion vnder both kinds, according to the ordinance of Chriſt, &amp; direction of the Apoſtles. And thus much of the generall vſes ariſing from both the ſignes ioyntly conſidered. Now let vs come to the particular vſes offered vnto vs,<note place="margin">Partic. vſe 1.</note> in each of the ſignes. And firſt touching the bread. Is bread ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply conſidered the firſt ſigne in the Lords Supper? Then it is not neceſſarily required, that it be adminiſtred in vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leauened bread. For bread is oftentimes named and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated: but the word (vnleauened) is neuer added. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore as it is in it ſelfe indifferent whether the wine be red or white, &amp; whatſoeuer the kinde or colour be (if it be wine:) ſo is it not greatly material whether the bread be leauened or vnleuened, ſo it be bread. Which ouerthrowes the error of the church of <hi>Rome</hi> &amp; her fauorits, who hold it<note n="l" place="margin">Beliar. lib. <hi>4.</hi> de Eucha cap. <hi>7.</hi>
                  </note> neceſſary that the bread vſed in the Sacrament be vnleauened. They pretend rhe inſtitution of Chriſt, who (ſay they) made the Sacrament of vnleauened bread, inſtituting it after he had eaten the Paſſeouer, which was to be eaten with vnleaue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned bread,<note n="m" place="margin">Exod. 12, 8.18.</note> according to the law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> neither was
<pb n="383" facs="tcp:21092:208"/> there any leaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to be found in <hi>Iſrael</hi> ſeauen daies together. Thus they charge vs to breake the inſtitution of Chriſt. But ſee heere the peeuiſhnes and partiality of theſe proud ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, who flye to the inſtitution, and ſticke preciſely to the circumſtances of it, when it ſerueth any way to their pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe: but when the queſtion is of matters of ſubſtance not of circumſtance, as touching communicating vnder both kinds, touching the neceſsity of eating and drinking, and of many receiuing together againſt their halfe communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, priuate maſſes, and reſeruations, they cannot abide to be tyed and yoked to the inſtitution. Indeed we deny not, but Chriſt might vſe vnleauened bread at his laſt Supper, hauing immediately before eaten the Paſchal Lambe. This peraduenture is truly coniectured: yet no ſuch thing is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed in the Goſpell, nor preſcribed as a rule neceſſarily to be followed. The Euangeliſts teach, he tooke bread: but make no mention or diſtinction what bread he tooke, nor determine what bread we ſhould take, no more then li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit what wine we ſhall vſe, but leaue it at liberty to take leauened bread or vnleauened, as occaſion of time, place, perſons, and other circumſtances ſerue, ſo we take bread; as their owne<note n="n" place="margin">Gregor. <hi>1.</hi> in Regiſtr.</note> Prophets haue confeſſed, and their owne Councels<note n="o" place="margin">Concil. Flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent. ſeſſ. vlt.</note> haue concluded. Wherefore, to conſecrate in vnleauened bread, is not of the ſubſtance of the Supper, no more then to eate it at night or after Supper, as Chriſt ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtred and the Apoſtles firſt receiued it. For if any would bring in a neceſsity of that time, as well as of that bread which Chriſt vſed, wee ſee as faire a warrant for the one as for the other: nay we haue a more certaine directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on for the time which is expreſſed, then for the kinde of bread which is not defined. Beſides, if Chriſt on this oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion vſed vnleauened bread: it was becauſe it was vſuall, common, and ordinary bread at that time, as we alſo ſhold vſe that bread which is vſuall and common. So the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle ſpeaketh of that bread which was daily vſed among the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> ſaying,<note n="p" place="margin">1 Cor. 10, 16</note> 
                  <hi>The bread which we breake:</hi> he addeth, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther leauened nor vnleauened, but vnderſtandeth that in common and continuall vſe. Thus then we conclude, it
<pb n="384" facs="tcp:21092:209"/> is no breach of Chriſts ordinance, nor a tranſgreſsion of the firſt originall inſtitution of the Lords Supper, to eate ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the one or the other.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Partic. vſe 2.</note>Againe, touching the other ſigne, which is the wine, the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> may iuſtly be charged with tranſgreſsing the ordinance of Chriſt, who by her ſole authority would tye vs to mingle water with wine for<note n="r" place="margin">Rhem.

                  <hi>great myſtery and ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nification,</hi> eſpecially, for that water guſhed with blood, out of our Lords ſide. So they condemne all thoſe Churches as doing impudently and damnably, that do not mixe water with wine in the Sacrament, and ſay it cannot bee omitted without great ſinne. True it is, the Church in former times, where the wine prouided for the Lords Table, was of it ſelfe heady, ſtrong, hot, fiery, and fuming, was wont to allay it with water, that it might be milde &amp; temperate: leaſt that which was taken to helpe and further the ſoule, ſhould diſquiet and diſtemper the body. This began for conueniency, not for neceſsity: for fitneſſe, not for ſignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation: for ſobriety, not for any myſtery. But the water is no part of Chriſts inſtitution, neither can it bee proued, that Chriſt or his Apoſtles vſed water with their wine, or commanded others to mingle wine and water in this my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery, or that Chriſts Apoſtles euer receiued it as a matter of faith, or taught it to be a neceſſary part of this Sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t. For <hi>Alexander</hi> the 5. Byſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> was the firſt that<note n="ſ" place="margin">Barth. Caran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>za ſum. Concil. Florent p. <hi>458.</hi>

                  </note> bread, and not of leauened, as till that time had beene vſed. Wherefore, let vs retaine and maintaine the plaine and ſimple inſtitution of Chriſt, who in his laſt Supper gaue wine, not water to be drunke, for he calleth it the fruite<note n="u" place="margin">Mat. 26, 29.</note> of the vine, which is wine and not water.</p>
               <p>Againe, they may be preſſed and hampered with their owne dreames and deuices. For whereas they hold that the wine muſt be mingled with water, &amp; that the elements after the words of conſecration are tranſubſtantiated, and remaine in their owne nature no more: I would aske this queſtion of theſe <hi>Watermen,</hi> rowing in the troubled ſea of
<pb n="385" facs="tcp:21092:209"/> their owne decrees (who are neere of kin<note n="a" place="margin">Papiſts are neere of kin to the old he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticks called <hi>Aquarij.</hi>
                  </note> to the old here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks called <hi>Aquarij</hi>) whether the water mixed with the wine be turned into blood? If they ſay it is not, then they deny tranſubſtantiation of all that is within the cup, and ſo ſhake the vertue of their conſecration in pieces: if they ſay it is, then will they make Chriſt a watery body and eleme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall: beſides, it cannot be by vertue of Chriſts inſtitution, where water is neither expreſſed nor included. So then, their beſt defence is to anſwere with the <hi>Phariſies,</hi>
                  <note n="b" place="margin">Mat. 21.23.</note> 
                  <hi>We can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not tell.</hi> To conclude, let vs not ſeeke to be wiſer the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Chriſt, nor to mingle together more myſteries then we haue lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned of him, as <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith of his owne practiſe,<note n="c" place="margin">1 Cor. 11, 23</note>

               <p>Thirdly, new ſacrifices are not to be inſtituted by men, without commandement of God, as <hi>Moſes</hi> teacheth, <hi>Deut.</hi> 12. We muſt not do what ſeemeth good in our own eyes, but take heed and heare all theſe words which he comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth vs. Now Chriſt neuer ſaid, Sacrifice ye my body and blood to God. Fourthly, Chriſt tooke the bread and gaue it to his Diſciples, he did not offer it vp to God the Father, he tooke the cup and bad them all drinke of it: he did not turne himſelfe to God, end deſire him then to accept the ſacrifice of his body and blood. Fiftly, if the bread and wine remain in their former ſubſtance in the Lords Supper: then bread and wine onely are offered, not the body and blood of Chriſt, but they remaine: for Chriſt deliuered<note n="i" place="margin">1 Cor. 10, 16</note> bread to his diſciples, and <hi>Paul</hi> teacheth that it is the bread which is broken, and that as often as they ſhall eate this bread and drinke of this cup, they ſhew the Lords death: therefore their reall Sacrifice is reall Idolatry. Sixtly, it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth in the inſtitution of the Supper, that Chriſt conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crated the bread apart, and the wine apart, and afterward deliuered them both apart, but the body of Chriſt was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer ſacrificed without the blood, nor the blood without the fleſh: for Chriſt offered vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Altar of the Croſſe the ſacrifice of his body and blood together, this is the cauſe that he ſaide, <hi>Take ye, eate ye, drinke ye,</hi> not take ye to offer and to ſacrifice.</p>
               <p>Seuenthly, the Scripture teacheth vs one offering and ſacrifice for ſin once performed and offered. Heb. 10. <hi>We are ſanctified by the offering of Ieſus Chriſt</hi>
                  <note n="k" place="margin">Heb. 10.12.</note> 
                  <hi>once made:</hi> &amp; ver. 12. <hi>This man after he had offered one ſacrifice for ſinnes, ſitteth at the right hand of God.</hi> And the Apoſtle, 1 Tim. 2. <hi>There is one meditator betweene God and men, the man Ieſus Chriſt, who gaue himſelfe a ranſome for all men.</hi> So 1 Ioh. 2. <hi>If any man ſinne, we haue an aduocate with the Father, Ieſus Chriſt the righteous, and hee is the propitiation for our ſins.</hi> Likewiſe Heb. 9. <hi>By his owne blood he entred in once vnto the holy place, &amp; obtained eternall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption for vs: not that he ſhould offer himſelfe</hi>
                  <note n="l" place="margin">Heb. 9, 12, 25</note> 
                  <hi>often, as the high Prieſt entred into the holy place euery yeare, with other blood
<pb n="393" facs="tcp:21092:213"/> (for then muſt he haue often ſuffered ſince the foundation of the world) but now in the end of the world hath he bin made manifeſt once to put away ſin by the ſacrifice of himſelfe.</hi> We haue plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifull teſtimonies of this truth in this Epiſtle, as chap. 10. <hi>Where remiſsion of theſe things is, there is no</hi>
                  <note n="m" place="margin">Heb 10, 18</note> 
                  <hi>more offering for ſin.</hi> If then we haue remiſsion by the ſacrifice of Chriſt, all other ſacrifices are ſuperfluous, and abrogate his al-ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent ſacrifice. So Rom. 6. <hi>In that he dyed, he dyed for ſin</hi>
                  <note n="n" place="margin">Rom. 6, 10.</note> 
                  <hi>once.</hi> And 1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. <hi>Chriſt alſo hath once ſuffered for ſins, the iuſt for the vniuſt.</hi> If then this perfect offering were once onely to be offered, then he is not offered, neither can be offered a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine in the Maſſe. And if the only oblation of Chriſt once offered by himſelfe be ſufficient: al other oblations and ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices are vaine and ſuperfluous. For how is that perfect, which is often repeated?</p>
               <p>Eightly, to make a lawfull ſacrifice, there is required ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily a fit Miniſter lawfully called of God, for<note n="o" place="margin">Heb. 5, 4, 5.</note> no man taketh this honour to himſelfe but he that is called of God, as was <hi>Aaron:</hi> ſo likewiſe Chriſt tooke not to himſelfe this honour to be made the high-Prieſt, but he that ſaid to him, Thou art my Sonne, this day I begat thee, gaue it him. But Chriſt is the onely Prieſt of the new teſtament, his Prieſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood is immortall and eternall, he liueth for euer, therfore the popiſh Prieſt-hood is a plant neuer planted by the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly Father the<note n="p" place="margin">Ioh. 15, 1.2.</note> true husband-man, and the popiſh Prieſts were neuer called of God to ſacrifice the body and blood of Chriſt, he gaue vnto them no ſuch authority,<note n="q" place="margin">Mat. 15, 23.</note> and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in time ſhall be rooted vp. If they pretend the precept and planting of God, let them ſhew their commiſsion that we may ſee it, and let them bring forth their charter that we may trye it, otherwiſe we muſt take them for vſurpers, and counterfeit Officers in the citty of God.</p>
               <p>Ninthly, the Apoſtle teacheth, that without ſhedding of blood is no<note n="r" place="margin">Heb. 9, 22.</note> remiſsion: But in the vnbloody ſacrifice of the Maſſe, there is not effuſion of blood, he doth not ſuffer, he is not killed, he doth not ſhed his blood, he doth not die: therefore in the Maſſe is no remiſsion of any ſins.</p>
               <p>Tenthly, if Chriſt be daily offered in the Maſſe, then he
<pb n="394" facs="tcp:21092:214"/> doth daily ſatisfie for ſinne, for the end of his offering is to make ſatisfaction, as Rom. 4, 25.<note n="ſ" place="margin">Rom. 4 25.</note>

Indeed we deny not, but the Maſſe may be beneficial to the rabble of Fryers and ſacrificing Prieſts that make it gaine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to themſelues, who through their ſale and merchandize of Maſſes, dwell ſtately, go ſumptuouſly, fare delicately, drinke wine in ſiluer and gold, abound in pleaſures, and heape vp great aboundance of all riches: ſhall we not now ſay, the Maſſe is profitable?

<pb n="395" facs="tcp:21092:214"/> in themſelues, diſhonourable to God, and hurtfull to the people. For firſt, the Sacrament was inſtituted to no ſuch end and purpoſe, as to helpe the dead, and to be a propiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation for their ſinnes. For Chriſt ſaid, Take and eate, this is my body: drinke ye, this is my blood: but the dead can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not take any thing offered vnto them: they can neither eate nor drinke: wherefore, this Supper being ſpirituall meate and nouriſhment for the ſoule, cannot auaile the dead, who are neither fed nor nouriſhed. Secondly, it profiteth as much to be baptized for the dead, as to receiue the Supper of the Lord for the dead: for both Sacraments were inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted of Chriſt, and there is the ſame reſpect of both. But it can doe no good to baptize one for another, the liuing for the dead, therefore the liuing comming to receiue the Sacrament of the Supper cannot releeue the dead.</p>

                  </note> deuoured by the Prieſt, nothing deliuered to the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. For whereas the ordinance of Chriſt and ancient or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of the Church was for the Miniſter &amp; people to receiue the Sacrament together: among them the Preſt accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied with his boy to make anſwere, receiueth the Sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t himſelfe alone, without diſtribution made to others, yea although the whole congregatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> be preſent and looke vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him, whereby God is diſhonoured, the communion is aboliſhed, the people of God are therby depriued and rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed of all comfort. How is this a feaſt which the Prieſt prepareth for himſelfe, not for others: receiueth by him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, not with his brethren: hee ſpeaketh to himſelfe, and not to the aſſembly: he vſeth a ſtrange tongue, and no man knoweth what he meaneth: the people is taught nothing, they vnderſtand nothing, they heare nothing, they receiue nothing; and a few childiſh, apiſh fooliſh, and vnſeemely geſtures excepted, they ſee nothing: they taſte nothing, they partake nothing, neither comfort of heart, nor memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of Chriſt, nor benefit of his paſsion. But Chriſt in his laſt Supper, did not eate vp all alone, but after the Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples had ſupped as <hi>Mathew</hi>
                  <note n="g" place="margin">Mat. 26, 26.</note> ſetteth it downe, he tooke bread &amp; bleſſed, he brake and gaue it to them, ſaying, take ye, eate ye: neither did he drinke alone of the fruite of the vine, but taking the cup he gaue thankes, and gaue to them all, ſaying, <hi>Drinke ye all of this.</hi> So then albeit a certaine number of communicants are not limited and determined:
<pb n="397" facs="tcp:21092:215"/> yet Chriſt in theſe words appointeth a company to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, as appeareth by the number, <hi>Take ye, eate ye, drinke yee all, diuide ye it among your ſelues, doe ye this in my remembrance, ye ſet forth the Lords death, when ye come together to eate, tarry ye one for another, as often as ye ſhall eate this bread.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Theſe words cannot bee vnderſtood of one particular man, but neceſſarily import a great number of men: nay, the Philoſopher teacheth, that the word <hi>(all)</hi> muſt be vere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied at the leaſt<note n="h" place="margin">Ariſt. lib. <hi>1.</hi> de Cocl. cap. <hi>1.</hi>
                  </note> of the number of three, which is the leaſt and loweſt number that would be admitted to this Supper. Neither doe we reade that ſo ſoone as one was gained to the faith, that the Apoſtles adminiſtred this Sacrament to him, much leſſe would they miniſter to themſelues alone, when none were conuerted in a nation or Citty.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Chriſt expreſly commandeth vs to do as him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe did, when hee left this fare-well token and pledge of his loue to his Diſciples, ſaying,<note n="i" place="margin">Luk. 22, 19.</note> 
                  <hi>Do this in remembrance of me.</hi> But he, after the words of conſecration, did not offer a ſacrifice to his Father vnder ſhewes of bread and wine, but gaue the bread and cuppe to his Diſciples, and left his owne example as a direction for vs to follow: ſo that the diſtribution &amp; deliuerance of the ſignes is of the ſubſtance of the Sacrament, as well as the breaking of the bread or pouring out of the wine, and it is not lawfull in any ſort to change the teſtament of Chriſt, or to corrupt the meaning of the teſtator. Thirdly, the Apoſtle teacheth how he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued from the Lord that which he deliuered to the chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, that the people ſhould eate of this bread and drinke of this cup:<note n="k" place="margin">1 Cor. 11, 23</note> and proueth that the faithfull are made par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers of the Lords Table, not by gazing or looking on while others eate, but by eating: not by ſtanding ſtil while others drinke, but by drinking, as 1 Cor. 10. <hi>We that are many are one bread and one body, becauſe we are all partakers of one bread.</hi> Fourthly, the ſame Apoſtle reproueth the <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinthians,</hi> which preſumed to take the Supper of the Lord before others, and did not tarry for their brethren when they came together to be partakers of the Sacrament, as we ſee, 1 Cor. 11. <hi>Euery man when they ſhould eate,</hi>
                  <note n="l" place="margin">1 Cor. 11.20, 22.</note> 
                  <hi>taketh his
<pb n="398" facs="tcp:21092:216"/> owne ſupper afore, this is not to eate the Lords Supper.</hi> And af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward, <hi>Wherefore my brethren, when ye come together to eate, tarry one for another.</hi> Now becauſe the <hi>Corinthians</hi> brake this order &amp; ordinance, he chargeth them to come vnreuerent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, to receiue vnworthily, to eate and drinke iudgement vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to themſelues. Shall they then that are faithfull Chriſtians, patiently beare the iniury done them by theſe ſacrificing Maſſe-mungers, who neuer bid the Lords gueſts, nor call them to his table, nor tarry for them till they come to this heauenly banket, but like the Prieſts of <hi>Bell,</hi> do eate and drinke vp all themſelues.</p>
               <p>Fiftly, the ſame Apoſtle willeth and warneth all perſons which come to this communion, diligently to proue &amp; ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine<note n="n" place="margin">1 Cor. 11, 28</note> themſelues, and then to come to this Supper, as we ſee, 1 Cor. 11. <hi>Let a man examine himſelfe, and ſo let him eate of this bread, and drinke of this cup:</hi> ſo that he would not haue any excluded from receiuing, which haue tryed their harts by examining, &amp; are thereby rightly prepared to this great worke. Laſtly, the names giuen to this Sacrament, noting the nature thereof, do affoord vs a good conſideration to ſtrike through the heart of this priuate Maſſe, being called ſometimes the Supper of the Lord, and ſometimes a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion among our ſelues. If it be an holy Supper and ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall banket, why are none bidden and called thereunto? If it be a communion, why doth the Prieſt vncharitably ſwallow all alone? wherby they make it a communion, but without company: a ſupper, but without gueſts: meat, but without eating: drinke, but without drinking: a table, but without ſitting downe: a participation, but without any that are partakers: a banket, but without feeding thereat, the people departing as hungry and thirſty as they came. Wherefore, as no man celebrated the Paſſeouer aright, or receiued profit thereby, but ſuch as did eate the fleſh ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of: ſo can none come to the ſupper of the Lord as he ought, though he looke vpon others, except he eate of the bread and drinke of the cup, according to the commandement of Chriſt, the author thereof. But becauſe the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> is neuer mad without reaſon, let vs driue them out of
<pb n="399" facs="tcp:21092:216"/> all their ſhifts and ſtarting holes, wherein they go about to hide their heads. Firſt, they aske the queſtion, What if <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Obiection </seg>1</label> their be none worthy to communicate, may wee not haue Maſſes without communicants? I anſwere, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Anſwere. </seg>
                  </label> this is to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe an impoſsibility. For whereſoeuer the word is truly preached, it gaineth ſome to the faith, Chriſt being in the midſt of them that are gathered together in his name: and therefore it neuer happeneth that all become vnworthy. The word of God hath his effect, and one part of the ſeed <hi>falleth into good ground,</hi> as we ſee in the parable of the ſower.<note place="margin">Luk. 8, 15.</note> And if it could come to paſſe which is heere imagined, it were better to abſtaine for a ſeaſon then to break the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement of Chriſt, according to the rule of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle, <hi>When ye come together to eate, tarry one for another.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 Cor. 11, 33.</note> Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thermore, the Prieſt knoweth not the worthineſſe or vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthineſſe of the greateſt part: if any offer themſelues to receiue, they muſt be receiued, when their ſinne is not knowne.</p>
               <p>Secondly, they ſay that priuate Maſſes may bee called <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Obiection </seg>2</label> common, becauſe the people heerein communicate ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally, and becauſe they are celebrated by the publike Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter. <label type="milestone">

                  </label> Heere wee haue common Maſſes without a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion, and without any Communicants: howbeit this is true, that heere is no communion at all in breaking of bread, and eating it beeing broken, commanded in the Goſpell.</p>
               <p>What agreement then is there betweene Chriſt ſitting at the Table with his Diſciples, diſtributing the bread, and miniſtring the cup vnto them; and the Maſſe-Prieſt ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding alone at an Altar, and eating all alone, without being ſeene of the people? Beſides, if a Miniſter pray alone in a corner of the Church, yet his prayer cannot be called pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like, albeit it be made by a publike perſon, and offered vp for all that are abſent, and conceiued in a publike Temple. The like may be ſaide, of the adminiſtration of the Lords Supper.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, they pretend that the cauſe why the people <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Obiection </seg>3</label> do not communicate, is their want of deuotion and good
<pb n="400" facs="tcp:21092:217"/> affection that they ought to haue to holy things, Heere is a new colour ſet vpon a foule and deformed face. <label type="milestone">

                  </label> A man would thinke that heareth theſe excuſes, that the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> did onely tollerate priuate Maſſes, but not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand them; and that they deſire they ſhould be publike &amp; common, were it not for the ſlothfulneſſe and the back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardneſſe of the people.<note place="margin">

Againe, if they deſired that the people ſhould communicate, they would reproue their negligence, and ſtir them vp to grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter diligence: whereas they confirme them and continue them in it, and apply themſelues vnto it, and leade them into error by their owne example. Neither haue they cauſe to make ſuch a generall complaint, ſeeing the people for the moſt part are more deuout and religious then the Paſtors of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> as it was in the dayes of <hi>Hezekiah.</hi> 2. Chron. 30.</p>

                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Obiection </seg>4</label> Fourthly, they demand whether it be the faſhion at feaſts to conſtraine them to eate that are not diſpoſed to eate? Is not euery one left to himſelfe, whether hee will eate or not eate? I anſwere, <label type="milestone">

                  </label> the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> leaue it not at liberty for the people to eate, or not to eate: but vtterly forbid them and reſtraine them. Secondly, at our common feaſts, no man is compelled to eate, becauſe there is no abſolute commandement of God to binde them vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to it: but in this holy feaſt it is farre otherwiſe, for we haue the expreſſe commandement of God, to take and eate all of vs. Laſtly, this compariſon of a feaſt ill beſitteth their whole purpoſe. For who euer ſaw a feaſt, where all the gueſts that are bidden ſtand by and eate nothing, and the Gouernor of the feaſt deuoureth and ſwalloweth vp all a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone, as it falleth out in the Maſſe, where no body but the Prieſt eateth?

The ſecond is, that the <hi>Euchariſt</hi> without Communicants is the ſeruice of God: theſe points they take for granted, but they neuer go about to prooue them and confirme them. If we will receiue ſuch traſh at their bare word, ſo it is: if not, they haue not a dram of reaſon to eſtabliſh it. Furthermore, whereas they adde that the ordinances which God hath commanded, ought not to be left for the indiſpoſition of particular men; I would know whether the Miniſter ſhould pray in the Church openly, when there is none to ioyne with him? Or whether hee ſhould preach the word, when there are none to heare him? If he may not, then how ſhould hee deliuer the Supper, when there are no gueſts? I will heere conclude with the complaint that <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> vſeth in his time, when this corruption began to creepe in: <hi>O cuſtome! O preſumption!</hi>

For the word of God and inſtitution of the Sacrament are perfect directions to the Church, teaching all matters of faith and obedience, yet they teach no ſuch practiſe.

               <p>Againe, Chriſt adminiſtred it not faſting, the Apoſtles receiued it not faſting: not that we are bound to celebrate the Supper at that time: but to ſhew that Chriſt would ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer haue choſen to doe it after ſupper, if that time had bin ſimply vnlawfull.</p>

The bread indeed we confeſſe is before vs when we pray to God for his bleſsing vpon it, that it may auaile vs to the end for which hee hath appointed it, euen as the meate which we ordinarily receiue in our houſes, is before vs vpon the Table when we do giue thankes for it.

                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Anſwere. </seg>
                  </label> firſt, that ſome of them ſpeake by ſuppoſition and by way of conceſsion, that albeit it be not expreſſed, yet it may be yeelded vnto. Againe, they ſpeake of it, as of a matter that is probable &amp; moſt likely: howbeit they make of it no matter of faith, nor article of religion, nor point of ſaluation, much leſſe do they turne a ceremony into ſubſtance, or a circumſtance in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the eſſence it ſelfe. And if this will content them, wee can eaſily yeeld it vnto them, that it is moſt probable that Chriſt and his Diſciples ſate. Neuertheleſſe, from a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that is likely, we may not conclude it to be a matter ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary, becauſe albeit they ſate at the Paſſeouer, the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture might peraduenture be altered at the Supper, many things paſsing betweene the keeping of the one and the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration of the other. For heere I would be reſolued
<pb facs="tcp:21092:222"/> of theſe points, whether of a matter not written, wee may conclude a matter not done? Secondly, I demand, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they can poſsibly proue the ſitting of the Diſciples by any inuincible argument, if any man wil deny it? I aske this the rather, becauſe if it were a matter of ſo great waight and importance, that we ſhould rather not communicate at all then kneele, and that it were no leſſe a ſinne then Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, which is the worſhipping of Images, we muſt haue plaine Scripture and euident proofe to inforce the neceſsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of ſitting, we muſt not be led by coniectures, nor go by probabilities, which in the matters of God do deceiue, and oftentimes it falleth out,<note place="margin">Ariſt. Topic.</note> that <hi>many falſhoods are more proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble then truths;</hi> becauſe we iudge of truth by the nature of it ſelfe, but of probality by the opinion of men. Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, I would know, whether among ſo many Authors and authorities alledged touching ſitting, or ſtanding at the communion, they be content to ſtand to a verdit of twelue men, and ſo to haue the matter paſſe by a Iury touching the lawfulnes or vnlawfulneſſe of kneeling? This is our coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try law, and this offer they cannot diſlike, foraſmuch as the witneſſes are their owne, and we will take exceptions to none of their depoſitions. They tell vs indeed that ſome were wont to ſit, and ſome to ſtand, and that diuers haue wiſhed that kneeling might bee remoued, fearing that it ſhould be an occaſion of Idolatry, but they proue not the point in queſtion, to wit, that it is vnlawful to receiue knee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling: or that men ought to abſtaine rather then kneele, and not ſit. But of this we ſhal haue better occaſion to ſpeake more afterward. Now then, to returne to the former mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, ſeeing they cannot proue by force of reaſon but by pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bability of truth, what geſture Chriſt and his Diſciples v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, how is it that they would gather a certaine doctrine from an vncertaine doing? But be it that it were true, that the Scripture had determined what particular geſture was vſed, and that both Chriſt and his Diſciples ſate at the Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, I will diduct from hence this concluſion, which I ſee not how they can auoid.</p>
               <q>
                  <p>If it be neceſſary for the people to ſit in the acte of receiuing,
<pb n="412" facs="tcp:21092:223"/> then it is neceſſary alſo for the Miniſter to ſit in the deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of it:</p>
                  <p>But it is not neceſſary for the Miniſter to ſit in the deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of it,</p>
                  <p>Therefore it is not neceſſary for the people to ſit at the recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing of it.</p>
               </q>
               <p>The conſequence of the firſt propoſition, if it be deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, is eaſily proued, becauſe as the geſture of the Diſciples muſt be a direction to the people, ſo the geſture of Chriſt muſt be an inſtruction to the Miniſter. The Diſciples did take the bread into their hands and did eate it, they tooke the cup and dranke thereof: theſe are ſet downe to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples what the people ought to do. Chriſt Ieſus tooke the bread and bleſſed, he brake it and gaue it, he tooke the cup, he bleſſed, he powred out the wine and gaue it; thus he did, and thus ought the Miniſters after his example to do. So then if the Diſciples ſate at the Table (I ſpeake by ſuppoſition) and the people be for that cauſe bound to ſit at the Supper: then likewiſe if Chriſt ſate, the Miniſters ought not to deliuer it ſtanding, or walking, but ſitting. But if the Miniſters be not bound to ſit as they deliuer it, no more are the people bound to ſit as they receiue it: foraſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as according to their opinion and allegation, there was a coherence and connexion of both theſe together in the firſt inſtitution. The aſſumption or ſecond part of the former reaſon, to wit, that <hi>it is not neceſſary for the Miniſter to ſit,</hi> I wil not ſpend any words to ſtrengthen, leaſt I ſhould ſeeme to fight with mine owne ſhaddow, and to go about to proue that which no man deryeth: and therefore if it muſt be left indiffere<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t in it ſelfe for the Miniſter to ſit or to ſtand, it can by no meanes be made neceſſary for the people to ſit onely. And if the geſture of Chriſt and his Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples were al one, how can they that cleaue ſo ſtrictly to the inſtitution allow, that the geſture of the Miniſters and peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple ſhould be different?<note place="margin">Three de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued.</note> Wherefore, if it may be thought reaſonable, I require theſe three things to be proued vnto me: Firſt, that the Diſciples ſate at the Table at the parta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of the Lords Supper. Neither would I haue them
<pb n="413" facs="tcp:21092:223"/> tell me of likelihoods, and preſumptions, and probabili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties: but becauſe kneeling reuerently is made flat Idolatry, or at leaſt is held to be a ſpice and to beare a ſhew of Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry, I demand plaine, euident, and direct proofes, ſuch as may ſatisfie the conſcience: and ſo much the rather, becauſe they make it a matter of conſcience, that we may ſee how they will perſwade another, who are or at leaſt will ſeeme to be ſo certainly reſolued themſelues. Secondly, albeit it were ſufficiently proued by ſtrong and vndoubted de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrations, that not onely Chriſt but his Diſciples ſate, yet they haue not gained and obtained that which they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire, foraſmuch as we come vpon them with a ſecond de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, harder for them to proue then the former, nay I will ſay, more vnpoſsible, to wit, whether the ſuppoſed ſitting vſed by Chriſt and his Apoſtles were the ſame that is vſed with vs, or not? If they confeſſe it is not the ſame, how is it that they call vs ſo much to the inſtitution? Or how is it that the Diſciples vſed one geſture, and they allow, &amp; require, and practiſe another? If they affirme that their ſiting was as our ſitting, they are eaſily conuinced both by euident teſtimonies of the Scriptures, and by the cleere au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorities of godly Writers, and by the continuall practiſe of thoſe Eaſterne countries euen vnto this day. For if wee will ſpeake truely and properly of ſitting, as we do account of ſitting, which is done with the body vpright, neyther Chriſt nor his Diſciples ſate at the Paſſeouer, as wee haue the deſcription thereof ſet downe by the Apoſtle <hi>Iohn:</hi> and therefore after that Chriſt had teſtified and told them, <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily, verily, I ſay vnto you, one of you ſhall betray me:</hi>

                  </note> the Euan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geliſt addeth, <hi>Now there was leaning on Ieſus boſome one of his Diſciples whom Ieſus loued, Simon Peter therefore beckoned vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him that he ſhould aske who it ſhould be of whom he ſpake? hee then lying on Ieſus breaſt, ſaid vnto him, Lord who is it?</hi> Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by by it appeareth, that their ſitting was not as our ſitting, but a kinde of leaning or bowing downe of the body, not an vpright carriage or ſcituation of it. If then they receiued the Paſſeouer leaning or lying all along, according to the faſhion of thoſe times, and thoſe places, and thoſe perſons,
<pb n="414" facs="tcp:21092:224"/> it muſt follow by good ſtrength of reaſon, that if they ſate at the Supper, they ſate not, as wee call ſitting, but leaned at it and lay along, which we would account according to the manners and cuſtomes of our countries wherein wee dwell, to be very vnciuill, and vnſeemely, and vndecent. And this is the iudgement of the learned. <hi>Beza</hi> writing vpon the former words touching the Diſciples leaning on Ieſus boſome, ſaith, <hi>This is to bee referred to the ſitting downe of the ancient,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Beza annot vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on lib. <hi>13.</hi>

                  <hi>that many being ſet, the laſt did as it were leane backe vpon the former, his feete being laide out from him.</hi> And <hi>Caluine</hi> vpon the ſame words vſeth theſe words in his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentaries vpon <hi>Iohn,</hi>

                  <hi>It might ſeeme an vndecent thing at this day, but ſuch was their manner of ſitting at that time: for they ſate not at a table as we do now, but hauing put off their ſhooes and leaning vpon Cuſhions, they ſate halfe vpright in beds, or they lay all along vpon little beds with their bodyes halfe way bolt vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus we ſee how it was in Chriſts time: and thus it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth to haue beene before in the times of the Prophets. In the book of <hi>Eſter</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Eſter 7, 8.</note> it appeareth they lay along vpon their beds when they were at their bankets and feaſts, chapter 7. <hi>Then the King returned out of the Pallace garden into the Pallace of the banket of wine, and Haman was fallen vpon the bed wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Eſter was.</hi> And in the Propheſie of <hi>Amos,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Amos 2, 8.</note> hee ſpeaketh againſt the cruelty and oppreſsion of the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> chap. 2. 8. <hi>They lay themſelues downe vpon clothes laide to pledge by e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery Altar, &amp; they dr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>nke the wine of the condemned in the houſe of their God.</hi> Whereby it is plaine, and might yet be made plainer by infinite teſtimonies ſacred and prophane, that their ſitting was much different from ours, and therefore I would know whether our receiued cuſtom of a moſt hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and reuerent geſture of kneeling, ought to bee chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged into lying all along obſerued by Chriſt and his Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, our ſhooes being pulled off, and Cuſhions lying vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der our elbowes? From hence then we reaſon thus.</p>
               <q>
                  <p>If we be tyed preciſely to the example of Chriſt and his Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, then we muſt leane and lye downe all along in receiuing the Supper:</p>
                  <pb n="415" facs="tcp:21092:224"/>
                  <p>But we muſt not leane and lye downe all along in receiuing the Supper:</p>
                  <p>Therefore we are not tyed preciſely to the example of Chriſt and his Diſc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ples.</p>
               </q>
               <p>So then, except they can ſhew vs that leaning is ſitting, &amp; that ſtooping is all one with being vpright, they can neuer warrant that manner of ſitting which they require to be v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed at the Communion. Laſtly, I demand to haue it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, that in euery point we are tyed to the inſtitution, and that it is not lawfull for the Church in any caſe to depart from the firſt celebration thereof. But we know that Chriſt before he adminiſtred his laſt Supper, did eate the Paſſeo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer with his Diſciples, and deliuered it at euening, Mathew 26, 20.<note place="margin">Mat. 26, 20.</note> He deliuered his Supper alſo in a priuate houſe, and in an vpper Chamber, he inſtituted it after Supper, when their bellies were filled and hunger ſatisfied. But wee are not bound, neither hath the Church thought fit to haue it receiued in the ſame manner, neyther tying the receiuers to vnleauened bread, nor to priuate houſes, nor to the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uening of the day, nor after our ordinary ſuppers, and therefore we are not tyed to euery circumſtance in the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution.</p>
               <p>If it bee anſwered that Chriſt made ſpeciall choice of theſe things aboue any other, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Obiection. </seg>
                  </label> that it might appeare the ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per came in place of the Paſſeouer; I might as well reply, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Anſwere </seg>
                  </label> the Euangeliſts expreſſed not what geſture was vſed, that we ſhould learne not to contend about it: as wee haue no mention what bread was vſed, that we might know it skil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth not whether we take leauened or vnleauened, ſo that it bee bread. But to paſſe that ouer, wee haue gained thus much, that as all the circumſtances of the inſtitution are not written for our imitation, ſo neyther are all vnlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full that are not warranted from the inſtitution. And thus haue we an anſwere ſhaped to their argument, which is thus concluded,
<q>
                     <p>Whatſoeuer croſſeth the practiſe of our Sauiour, muſt not be allowed off.</p>
                     <p>But kneeling croſſeth the practiſe of our Sauiour,</p>
                     <pb n="416" facs="tcp:21092:225"/>
                     <p>Therefore kneeling is not to be allowed off.</p>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>The propoſition muſt be warily vnderſtood and limited according to the rule of the Scripture, or elſe being gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally vttered, it is falſe, and taken vp both by Anabaptiſts in the queſtion of the baptizing of Infants, and by the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts in the point of vnleauened bread. The Anabaptiſts build vpon this foundation, Chriſt was baptized at thirtie yeares, and we trow hee knew well the right vſe of the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament, therfore neither ought we to be baptized ſooner. But if this were a good conſequent, and might paſſe with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out controlement, then muſt we be firſt circumciſed, and afterward baptized, then muſt baptiſme be adminiſtred in Iordan or in ſome riuer. So in the controuerſie betweene the Church of Rome and vs, whether leauened or vnleaue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned bread is to be vſed, Bellarmine reaſoneth thus; Chriſt at his laſt Supper vſed vnleauened bread,<note place="margin">Bellar de Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>char li. <hi>4.</hi> ca. <hi>7</hi>
                  </note> therefore we muſt alſo: for it cannot be doubted, but that is far better and ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to be done which Chriſt himſelfe did. But if we muſt giue place to this kinde of reaſoning, and grant any force to be in it, then it wil as well follow from Chriſts example, that the Sacrament of the Lords Supper muſt bee receiued in an vpper chamber, not in the open Church: at euening, not in the morning: after ſupper, not before dinner; none of which we will grant, albeit all of them ſtand grounded vpon the practiſe of Chriſt. Beſides, it is well enough knowne, that the Church of <hi>Geneua</hi> do not account them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues or any other church bound in the action of receiuing to the platforme of the inſtitution, or the practiſe of the Diſciples, and therefore the people doe receiue it at the hands of their Miniſters ſtanding, and do eate it walking and paſsing from them: and their Elders which are their Gouernors for diſcipline, do reach the cup vnto them. Fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> hence we may fitly retort and returne the former argument vpon their owne heads.</p>
               <q>
                  <p>Whatſoeuer croſſeth the practiſe of our Sauiour, muſt not be alowed off:</p>
               </q>
               <p>This is their owne propoſition, I hope they know it &amp; will not deny it. Then we aſſume,</p>

               <q>
                  <p>But the order of the Church of Geneua, receiuing ſtanding, croſſeth the practiſe of our Sauiour:</p>
                  <p>Therefore the order of the Church of Geneua, receiuing ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, is not to be allowed off.</p>
               </q>
               <p>Wherefore if we will vnderſtand the former propoſition a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right, we muſt reſtraine it to ſuch things as are eſſential and haue commandement from the word; for whatſoeuer croſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth the practiſe of our Sauiour in any materiall point, of which he hath ſaid, <hi>Do this in remembrance of me,</hi> doubtleſſe that is not to be allowed of.

But it is called a Supper for other cauſes, as we haue noted in the firſt chap. of this booke. Againe, the more common and vſuall geſture obſerued at bankets, is to ſtand, and not to ſit: and therfore by this reaſon, we ſhould haue neither ſitting nor kneeling, but ſtanding at the Table of the Lord.

                  <p>Argu. 4. It ſeemeth in the primitiue Church they vſed to kneele at this action, becauſe the Pagans obiected to the Chriſtians that they worſhipped <hi>Ceres</hi> &amp; <hi>Bacchus: (Auguſt. contra Faustum)</hi>

                     </note> Secondly, if we take it as a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall rule, it muſt be reſtrained, and not extended to al things which come neere euill. Our abſtinence from fleſh in time of Lent and other dayes being commanded by autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, may ſeeme to be drawne within the compaſſe of that precept, if we reſtraine it not. For it hath an appearance of the ſuperſtitious religious faſt of the Papiſts. There is abſtinence from fleſh in both, yet the end is farre different: they to worſhip God, we for politicke and ciuill reſpects. So heere the outward geſture is like in both, they kneele, and we kneele: but the end is different, they to adore the bread, we to adore God. Beſides, in the primitiue church, the chriſtia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s in prayer turned their faces to the Eaſt, which was an appearance of worſhipping the Sunne, and ſo were they charged to do by the <hi>Gentiles:</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Tert. in Apol.</note> yet in it ſelfe it is not vnlawfull to turne to the Eaſt in prayer. The fact of <hi>Paul</hi> in ioyning with the <hi>Iewes</hi> in a worke of the ceremonial law,<note place="margin">Act. 21.</note> to wit, purifying, might as well (as this geſture) be drawne within the compaſſe of the former precept, as making for the confirming of the <hi>Iewes</hi> in the neceſsity of keeping the ceremoniall law. Many ſuch inſtances might be brought to this purpoſe. I take it therefore that this geſture of kneeling cannot be ſaid to be the appearance of euill, but onely in reſpect of the circumſtances, as if among Papiſts receiuing with adoration, a Proteſtant ſhould receiue and kneele, heere indeed is appearance of euill. Or a perſon
<pb n="427" facs="tcp:21092:230"/> that is doubted of, whether hee bee a Conſubſtantiaſt or Tranſubſtantiaſt, ſhould receiue with kneeling, and would not receiue otherwiſe, this would breed great ſuſpition, &amp; kneeling would proue in ſuch a perſon the appearance of euill. But being vſed of vs renouncing theſe doctrines, it is not ſo. Wherefore that precept muſt thus be vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood, whatſoeuer hath in it ſelfe an appearance of euill, is to be auoyded ſimply. But not ſo, that which may haue ſome ſuch appearance by reaſon of ſome circumſtances of time, or place, or perſons. Remoue thoſe circumſtances, as they are in this caſe remoued with vs, and the thing then may be vſed, and yet no appearance at all of euill.</p>
                  <p>Theſe reaſons and anſweres to obiections I receiued from a graue and iudicious Diuine which I haue heere ſet downe, which I dare be bold to affirme, are of more force &amp; greater importance then any thing that euer I haue read or heard obiected againſt our kneeling at the Communion. And therefore if we will not be wedded to our owne iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, or carried away violently as it were with the ſtreame of ſelfe-loue and a preiudicate opinion, let vs yeeld our ſelues to the ſtrength of theſe arguments, and acknowledge the weakeneſſe of the contrary obiections. Now that I might omit no defence of thoſe that are otherwiſe minded vnanſwered; and thereby leaue thoſe of weaker iudgment, that relye too much vpon them, vnſatisfied: let vs particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly examine the arguments, which are as the grounds and foundations whereupon they build. Firſt they obiect,<note place="margin">The firſt ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument</note> that kneeling at the Communion is an humane inuention of no neceſsity, vſed and abuſed to Idolatry. I anſwere, that touching the adminiſtration of the Sacraments, there is &amp; alwayes hath bin <hi>aliquid humani,</hi> that is, ſomething left to man to order and appoint. In all times of the Church, God hath had his Sacraments, and at all times he hath left ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what arbitrary, whereof he hath ſpoken nothing, but left it to the diſcretion of men. Take the firſt Sacrament for an example in a ſetled Church, I meane Circumciſion. The cutting off of the fore-skin is appointed, and the day of the adminiſtration of it is limited; but by what Miniſter, or by
<pb n="428" facs="tcp:21092:231"/> what inſtrument, or with what prayers, or with what words of inſtitution it is to be practiſed, is neither expreſſed, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther can be collected. The like wee might ſay touching the Paſſeouer, who is able to tel vs how it was conſecrated, snd with what prayers it was ſolemnized? yet we may not thinke that they were as dumbe ſhewes that had no word to informe the conſciences of ſuch as were partakers of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. We ſee alſo that it is left to the iudgement of the Church what prayers ſhall be vſed both at baptiſme &amp; at the Lords Supper. In baptiſme, dipping or waſhing; once or often: in the Supper, what bread it ſhall be, of what matter, of what forme, of what quantity we are to take: and touching the wine, of what colour, and in what cups it ſhall bee put, and ſundry ſuch like circumſtances euery Church determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth freely. Therefore all inuentions of men are not meere corruptions of the matter. The like we might ſay of the preciſe times of celebrating the Sacraments, which are not tyed to certaine dayes, all which are as waighty as ſitting is. And touching things abuſed to Idolatry, wee are not bound by and by to leaue them for the abuſe, but retaining the vſe remoue the abuſe. For who knoweth not that the bread it ſelfe hath beene and alſo is ſhamefully and groſly abuſed to Idolatry? and yet we are not to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part from the inſtitution of God for the ſuperſtitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of man. If any alledge againſt theſe things, <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Obiection. </seg>
                     </label> that ſome humane in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uentions may be vſed in Gods ſeruice, and ſome things which are abuſed to Idolatry may be vſed in Gods ſeruice, but not humane inuentions abuſed to Idolatry: Heereun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to I anſwere <label type="milestone">

                     </label> three things. Firſt, if humane traditions may be admitted into the worſhip of God, and likewiſe things abuſed to ſuperſtition, then why not humane traditions a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſed to ſuperſtition? If they may be receiued ſeuerally, why not ioyntly together? and if either of them, why not both of them? Secondly, kneeling at the Communion is not meerely humane, nor meerely diuine, but rather a mixt action compounded of both. <hi>Caluine</hi> in that learned and worthy worke of his <hi>Inſtitutions,</hi> mouing the queſtion, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther kneeling at time of ſolemne prayer be an humane tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition

                     </note> 
                     <hi>I ſay it is ſo an humane tradition that withall it is diuine. Gods it is, ſo farre foorth as it is a part of that beauty whoſe care and obſeruation is commended vnto vs by the Apoſtle: and it is mans or of men ſo far forth as it specially deſigneth what was ſhewed in the generall.</hi> The ſubſtance of which anſwere I take it to be this, that in the generall it is diuine, but in the ſpeciall it is humane. So touching the communion, this geſture may be called diuine in ſome part, becauſe it is enioyned by the church which we are commanded to hear, required by the Magiſtrate to whom we muſt be obedient for conſcience ſake,<note place="margin">Mat 18, 17. Rom. 13, 5.</note> and adminiſtred with a ſolemne and effectuall prayer, <hi>The body of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt which was giuen for thee, preſerue thy body and ſoule to euerlaſting life, &amp;c.</hi> &amp; in former time, as the Miniſter did vſe this prayer, ſo the people did teſtifie their conſent, and ioyne with the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter ſaying, <hi>Amen:</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Hiſt. li. <hi>7.</hi> cap. <hi>9.</hi>
                     </note> Hence it is that <hi>Euſebius</hi> in his Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſticall hiſtory witneſſeth, that bowing the hand they did receiue the body of Chriſt, and anſwered, <hi>Amen.</hi> And albeit this be not enioyned and commanded, yet I doubt not but euery right receiuer and true religious heart doth teſtifie his aſſent ſecretly vnto God, and deſireth that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly betweene God and his owne ſoule which the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter outwardly vttereth and expreſſeth. Thus may knee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling be ſaid not vnfitly to be diuine: and inaſmuch as it is appointed by men and from men, I confeſſe it may be ſaid to be humane. Laſtly, it were no hard matter to giue ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry inſtances of ſundry humane traditions that haue beene abuſed to Idolatry, and yet are not meerely vnlawfull, nor in themſelues euill when they are retained and receiued. Of this ſort is prayer toward the Eaſt an ordinance of man, and ſuch an action as hath beene very ſuperſtitiouſly abuſed: yet if it were impoſed vpon vs by authority, I ſee not but we might and ought to ſubmit our ſelues vnto it with all obedience. Of this kinde alſo is the ſetting of the Lords Supper vpon an Altar, which God neuer appointed, nor Chriſt himſelfe with his Diſciples obſerued, and it is that which hath beene and at this day is greatly abuſed in pope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry:
<pb n="430" facs="tcp:21092:232"/> yet if it were appointed that in euery church we ſhould haue Altars, as in ſome reformed churches is practiſed, why might wee not content our ſelues to receiue vpon Altars, prouided that all ſuperſtition be abandoned and remoued? Thus much of the firſt reaſon, which is the ground of all the reſt, and therefore we will paſſe them ouer briefly.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">The ſecond argument.</note>Secondly, it is obiected that kneeling is commanded with myſticall ſignification. I anſwere, the people of God in all times haue vſed ſuch actions and geſtures, as that they vſed them as helpes of their weakeneſſe, and furtherances of themſelues in true piety. Thus they vſed to rent their clothes to teſtifie their ſorrow and heauineſſe of heart, and ſome their diſpleaſure and indignation conceiued at that which they did ſee and behold with their eyes.</p>
                  <p>This was an humane tradition, and yet it had a myſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call ſignification, declaring the renting of the heart. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther doth the Prophet ſimply reproue it, but comparatiuely correct it,<note place="margin">Ioel 2, 13.</note> ſaying, <hi>Rent your heart, and not your garments,</hi> that is, rather this then them. For this cauſe alſo we vncouer the head, lift vp the eyes and hands in prayer. Now knee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling hath no other myſticall ſignification at the Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, then this and the former geſtures haue in prayer, ſhewing the humble and gratefull acknowledgment of the benefits of Chriſt with all thankſgiuing, beeing of our ſelues vnworthy (as we profeſſe) to gather vp the crums vnder his Table, and to receiue the leaſt of his mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">The third argument.</note>Thirdly, it is obiected that kneeling is impoſed as a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary part of Gods worſhippe. I anſwere as before, the kingdome of God conſiſteth not in this or ſuch like cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies. It is a wrong done vnto our Church to lay any ſuch imputation vpon it: foraſmuch as it doth no where &amp; vpon no perſon impoſe it is as a neceſſary part of the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice of God. For then it were vtterly vnlawfull to alter or change it, or to bring in any other geſture in ſtead ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of: becauſe it is not in the power of any Prince or people to abrogate any neceſſary part of the ſeruice of God. Howbeit we noted before out of the defence of the Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles
<pb n="431" facs="tcp:21092:232"/> againſt <hi>Harding,</hi> written by the reuerent Father in God, Biſhop <hi>Iewel</hi> of famous memory, that comming to the Communion faſting, and in receiuing, to ſit, or kneele, or ſtand, may be diſpoſed and determined by the Church: yet he neuer thought that the church had any authority to deſtroy &amp; aboliſh any neceſſary part of Gods ſeruice and worſhip. If any of the ignorant ſort doe iudge other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, it is their fond opinion, not the Churches reſoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. It skilleth not what any priuate perſon holdeth or may hold touching this point, neyther may the whole Church be iuſtly charged with it, and beare the blame of it.</p>
                  <p>The fourth and laſt argument<note place="margin">The fourth argument.</note> is of leſſe validity then the former. For as the firſt encounter hath the greateſt force, and the ſureſt guard is placed in the forefront; ſo hauing ſuſtained the ſhocke of that battell, I doubt not but to put to ſlight the poore remainder. It is obiected, that the action of kneeling ſwarueth from the generall rules appointed to direct indifferent things, which ſhould not be vngodly, nor offenſiue, nor vnfit, nor ridiculous, nor vnprofitable, nor vndecent. I anſwere, I haue pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued already, that this geſture containeth no wickedneſſe not impiety; it is not childiſh or ridiculous, neither hath it in it any ſhew or colour thereof; neyther is it offenſiue, except peraduenture any take offence at it. And tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching the indecency or vnfitneſſe of it, albeit I cannot ſee how it can be rightly ſo accounted among vs, where the people are taught and inſtructed how to vſe it, yet if this were granted, it cannot prooue the vnlawfulneſſe of it.</p>
                  <p>Thus I haue runne ouer as briefly as I could theſe rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, and opened the weakeneſſe of them to the faces of ſuch as vrge them. I haue not purpoſely concealed any waight or force that they may carry with the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> for mine own aduantage, but propounded the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to the view of al me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerely as I could, for the cauſe noted in the end of this diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe: neither do I know any learned writers beſide them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues againſt it. It is true, that ſome of late oppoſing the
<pb n="432" facs="tcp:21092:233"/> order of the church, do pretend ſundry teſtimonies and au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorities of many Authors, and paint the margins of their bookes with almoſt infinite quotations, but what do they all make either for them, or againſt vs? Do they ſpeake a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the lawfulneſſe of kneeling, or ſhew that it is againſt Gods word, or hold that all men ought to deny to yeeld vnto it? no ſuch matter. Nay, eyther they are ſilent in the point for which they are alledged, or elſe they are witneſſes directly depoſing againſt thoſe that alledge them. Let them without all circumlocution or multiplying of words informe vs, eyther by text of Scriptures, or decree of Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cels, or conſtitution of Emperors, or ſentence of Fathers, or iudgement of Martyrs, or determination of Diuines, who haue euer taught or publiſhed, that kneeling at the Lords Supper is vtterly vnlawfull. This as yet they haue not done, and by reaſon of their deepe ſilence in this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter I am perſwaded they cannot doe. Let them or any for them proue vnto vs directly, that wee ought by no meanes to ſubmit our ſelues to this geſture, or that wee may di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturbe the peace of the Church for it, either out of <hi>Caluine,</hi> or <hi>Beza,</hi> or <hi>Iunius,</hi> or <hi>Vrſinus,</hi> or <hi>Bucer,</hi> or <hi>Bullenger,</hi> or <hi>Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>canus,</hi> or <hi>Piſcator,</hi> or <hi>Paraeus,</hi> or <hi>Polanus,</hi> or <hi>Peter Martyr,</hi> or <hi>Aretius,</hi> or <hi>Gualter,</hi> or <hi>Muſculus,</hi> or in effect any of elder or later times: or ſhew vnto vs, that they haue aduiſed and counſelled any, either vtterly to abſtaine from, or for a time to forbeare the receiuing of the Communion, rather then to kneele at it, and then they ſhall ſpeake more to the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, and yeeld vnto vs better ſatisfaction. But if they be not able to bring vs one ſentence or ſillable out of theſe Writers which are produced by themſelues, or out of any other whoſe praiſe is in the Church for their worthy la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, becauſe their iudgement is plaine, let them freely confeſſe their error, and readily yeeld vnto the truth. Theſe are thoſe pillars of the church that haue carried the burden of the building, and thoſe labourers that haue borne the heat of the day; who albeit they haue written much of the Sacraments, and themſelues liued where they receiued ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſtanding or ſitting, yet neuer wrote againſt kneeling,
<pb n="433" facs="tcp:21092:233"/> nor condemned thoſe Churches that practiſed it, knowing very well that we are no more bound to follow them, then they are to follow vs. Indeed they haue all of them ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horred kneeling to the bread, but none of them haue ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horred kneeling at the receiuing of the bread: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore let them that haue beene ſo earneſt heeretofore for ſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting at the Communion, and to reaſon for the practiſe a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

So long as wee may take the bread and drinke of the cuppe of the Lord with hearing the word preached, with prayers and praiſes offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to God, let vs not ſtriue and contend in indifferent things, (as we haue proued this to be) which are to be or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered by the higher powers; but yeeld obedience to the truth, and be content to ioyne with our brethren, as in the action of the Supper, ſo in the geſture of the body, that ſo with ioy of heart and comfort of Spirit, with one minde &amp; with one mouth we may glorify our Father which is in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen.

I deny not but ſome haue held this ceremony needleſſe, vnprofitable, in expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, and fit to be aboliſhed, but not impious, vnlawfull, Idolatrous in it ſelfe. It is well ſaid of <hi>Beza</hi>

                     </note> in his ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Epiſtle, that albeit the Sacraments be inſtituted by Chriſt, and that by mans authority nothing ought to bee
<pb n="434" facs="tcp:21092:234"/> added to them or detracted from them, yet not euery de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clining from the inſtitution is to be accounted a corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, ſo that the intent and purpoſe of the Author of them be obſerued. When the Lord Ieſus did ordaine his laſt ſupper, it is moſt likely that the diſciples receiued the bread and the cup not at the hands of Chriſt, but one of another, foraſmuch as he tooke the cup and gaue thanks, and ſaid, <hi>Take this and diuide it among your ſelues,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Luke 22, 17.</note> and that all of them did drinke of one and the ſame cup: what then? Shall wee ſay that thoſe Churches offended, or that the commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Chriſt is tranſgreſſed, or that the inſtitution is vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olated, where one doth not deliuer the Sacrament to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, but all receiue it at the hand of the Miniſter, &amp; where they drinke alſo not of one, but of diuers cups? No, in no wiſe: becauſe the taking of the Elements is neceſſarily re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired, but the manner is not preciſely appointed and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed. And heereby alſo we ſee farther, that we are not ſeruilely bound to cleaue to the example of Chriſt in the adminiſtration and participation of the Supper: albeit on the other ſide we haue no purpoſe to oppoſe our ſelues any way againſt him; but inaſmuch as he hath left it free, we haue made choice of that we thinke fit. Thus I haue fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed the point which I intended, to bring backe our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued brethren and ſiſters to a willing ſubmiſsion to the orders of our Church in this behalfe. I haue of purpoſe ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtained from ſpeaking of many other points which I might haue touched, and peraduenture had beene fit to be obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, leaſt I ſhould exaſperate any way thoſe that are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary minded, and thereby driue them farther from that whereunto I goe about to perſwade them, and ſo wound thoſe whom I deſire to win. For I am ſo farre from go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing about to kindle the coales of contention, and mouing them any way to anger, or bringing them to trouble, whom I minde to gaine to the truth<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that if I haue let fall any thing from my pen, that they which are contrary to me in opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and to our Church in practiſe, might take to be ſpoken to their diſgrace, or vttered in contempt of their perſons, I do heere freely condemne it my ſelfe, before it come into
<pb n="435" facs="tcp:21092:234"/> other mens hands to be read of them: I ſeeke for verity, I ſtriue not for victory. In the matters of God we ſhould be farre from bitterneſſe, and eſpecially in things of this nature we ought to be patient toward al men. In all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trouerſies I account it an heauenly direction worthy to bee followed, ſet downe by the Apoſtle, Eph. 4.<note place="margin">Eph. 4, 31, 32.</note> 
                     <hi>Let all bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terneſſe, and wrath, and anger, and clamour, and euill speaking, be put away from you: and be ye kinde one to another, tender hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, forgiuing one another, euen as God for Chriſts ſake hath for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giuen you.</hi> And to conclude, I ſay with the ſame Apoſtle in another place, Gal. 6.<note place="margin">Gal 6, 16.</note>

Conſecration is a change or conuerting of the outward
<pb n="436" facs="tcp:21092:235"/> elements into another vſe, by obſeruing the whole inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Chriſt, which giueth it his effect. We confeſſe a tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and changing, not of one ſubſtance into another, not by aboliſhing of natures, not by cloſe pronouncing of cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine words: but in the vſe and in reſpect of vs,<note n="c" place="margin">The vſe of the elements is c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>anged: the ſubſtance is not chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged.</note> and in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of the promiſe of God. The water which flowed out of the rocke in the wilderneſſe, ſignified the ſame to the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, which the wine repreſenteth to vs in the Supper. Notwithſtanding, it was a common watering to the beaſts of the field, and to the people of God; the cattell dranke therof as wel as the people, &amp; therfore there could be made no change therein but in reſpect of men,<note n="d" place="margin">Num 20, 10.</note> to whom God gaue his gracious promiſe; which teacheth vs to account of the outward ſignes otherwiſe then of common meats &amp; common drinkes. The Tabernacle and the Arke, and all the inſtruments thereof were made of common matter, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they were ſanctified of God to that purpoſe. The ſtones hammered in the quarrey, the timber hewed in the Forreſt, the gold tryed in the furnace, were common ſtuffe, before they were laid in the building of the Temple,<note n="e" place="margin">Mat 23, 16.</note> and ſo made holy and ſanctified to God and man. The ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings &amp; ſentences<note n="f" place="margin">Act. 17.28. Tit. 1, 12. 1 Cor. 15, 33.</note> of the heatheniſh Poets were prophane, before they had paſſed through the Pen of God, and were taken vp by the Holy-Ghoſt. So we teach of the bread and wine, before the inſtitution of Chriſt is vſed and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerued, they are common: but afterward they are holy. We confeſſe and deny not, but ſay plainely there is a change in the Sacraments: the elements which before were ordinary meates, now become ſpirituall in reſpect of the vſe: before they ſerued onely to feed the belly, now they ſerue to ſeale vp the nouriſhment of our ſoules.</p>
               <p>The diſcuſsing of this queſtion,<note n="g" place="margin">Two means of conſecra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, to wit, the word and p ayer</note> together with the foundation of this conſecration and ſanctification of the creatures, is taken out of 1 Tim. 4, 4. <hi>Euery creature of God is good, &amp; nothing ought to be refuſed, if it be receiued with thanks<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giuing: for it is ſanctified</hi>

                  <hi>by the word of God &amp; prayer.</hi> Theſe are the two meanes, the word and prayer, whereby the Elements are changed, though not tranſubſtantiated, yet
<pb n="437" facs="tcp:21092:235"/> they haue a dignity and preheminence, which they had not before, they are no<note n="i" place="margin">Iuſt. in Apol. <hi>2</hi>
                  </note> more common bread, common wine, common meate, but a Sacrament of Chriſts body, a warrant of Gods promiſes, an holy myſtery, and ſeale of the couenant betweene God and vs. The firſt meanes of this conſecration and ſetting apart of the creatures to our vſe, is by the word of God. If we haue the euident and expreſſe word to warrant our vſe of the creatures of God, we may vſe them for our neceſsity and comfort: if we haue no word to beare out the practiſe, they are not ſanctified vnto vs. The tree of knowledge of good and euill, was not ſanctified vnto <hi>Adam,</hi> though it were good in it ſelfe (as all<note n="k" place="margin">Gen. 1.31.</note> creatures are) becauſe he had a word of comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement not to eate of it:<note n="l" place="margin">Gen. 2, 17.</note> 
                  <hi>Of the tree of the knowledge of good and euill, thou ſhalt not eate of it, for in the day that thou eateſt thereof, thou ſhalt dye the death.</hi> After the fall and after the flood, all creatures were not ſanctified, ſome were accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted<note n="m" place="margin">Gen. 7, 2.</note> vncleane, all might not be eaten, all might not be of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered: as vnder the law,<note n="n" place="margin">Leuit. 11, 3.</note> among the beaſts, onely they were cleane that did chew the cud, and diuide the hoofe: and among the fiſhes of the Sea, onely ſuch as had skales and ſinnes were called cleane, the reſt were vncleane vnto them, becauſe the word did not allow but reſtraine the vſe of them.</p>
               <p>So likewiſe for this Sacrament of the Lords Supper, not euery creature is ſanctified, not a lambe, not any fleſh, not any fiſh, not oyle: but onely bread and wine. Theſe two are conſecrated, all the reſt are cancelled by the word. For albeit fleſh be more like vnto fleſh then bread is, yet would he not make choice of any of that kinde, becauſe he reſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted not the colour and outward forme, but the force of nouriſhment &amp; ſtrengthening of the body, which is grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in bread, then in the fleſh of any creature.</p>
               <p>The ſecond meanes whereby the creatures are ſanctified, is by prayer. For albeit that God by the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ming of his Son into the world hath ſanctified all meates and drinkes, that nothing of it ſelfe is vncleane,<note n="o" place="margin">Rom. 14.15</note> but to him that counteth it vncleane: yet ſomething muſt neceſſarily bee done on
<pb n="438" facs="tcp:21092:236"/> our parts, otherwiſe that which is holy, we may prophane: and that which is good, we may turne into euill: &amp; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Apoſtle addeth prayer, which is both a thankſgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing to the Lord that he hath ſanctified and prepared them for vs, and likewiſe a petition that they may be healthfull for vs, and we thankefull for them, whereby our food, our apparell, and all the ſuccours of this life are ſanctified to his glory and our comfort.</p>
               <p>Theſe be the two meanes of conſecration: if theſe or any of them be wanting, there can be no true conſecration. If then in the time of the law they ſhould haue eaten ſwines fleſh, which indeed<note n="p" place="margin">Leuit. 11, 7.</note> part the hoofe, but chew not the cud: they ſhould haue ſinned, becauſe it was not ſanctified: and therefore albeit they had prayed for a bleſsing all the day long, and giuen thankes neuer ſo much, yet could it not make their p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>actiſe lawfull, which the word of God hath made vnlawfull. Or if they had offered a cleane and holy ſacrifice, and not made humble and earneſt prayers to God to accept them and their oblations, it could not haue due effect, but the word of God had beene hindred by their vnworthineſſe. So in the adminiſtration of the Lords ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred Supper, we vſe the word of God, which warranteth vs to take the bread and wine; out of this word we alledge the promiſes of God to the true beleeuer: and heereunto we ioyne prayers and thankſgiuing, that God would ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept vs and bleſſe vs in the participation of his owne ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance. Thus albeit we haue no forged tranſubſtantiati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, we haue a true conſecration: if the word of God and prayer of the Church can worke it, which are the meanes left vnto vs for this purpoſe: if we be<note n="q" place="margin">Ierom 20, 7.</note> any way deceiued, it is the Scripture which hath deceiued vs.</p>

                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Vſe </seg>1</label> It remaineth now to marke the vſes of this point for our farther inſtruction. If by vſing the whole inſtitution of Chriſt according to his commandement, wee confeſſe a change and conuerſion wrought in the vſe of the ſignes: then we are falſely charged and ſlandered to haue no con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecration. We pronounce the ſame words of conſecra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that Chriſt pronounced: we obſerue the ſame things
<pb n="439" facs="tcp:21092:236"/> that Chriſt obſerued, and charged vs to do: we ſhew forth plainly the death of Chriſt as if<note n="r" place="margin">Gal 3, 1.</note> he were deſcribed in our ſight, &amp; among vs crucified: we ſpeake openly in a knowne tongue, and the people vnderſtand vs: wee pray vnto God to accept vs, and render him thankes for the worke of our redemption: Laſtly, wee take the outward elements and ioyne the word vnto them, and thus they are made to vs a Sacrament.</p>
               <p>Nay, if to offer vp to God, our ſelues, our ſoules, our bodies, our almes for the poore, our prayers and thanksgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uings vnto God the Father for our redemption, be an obla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and a ſacrifice: we haue both a Sacrament and a ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice in our Churches, though we offer not vp Chriſts body to be a propitiatory ſacrifice for the redemption both of the quicke and dead vnto his Father. We offer vp as much as<note n="ſ" place="margin">We offer vp as much as Chriſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded vs.</note> Chriſt commanded vs to offer: but that ſacrifice was once offered vp vpon the Croſſe: he was the Prieſt, he was the Altar, he was the ſacrifice, there is no other ſacrifice left to be offered for ſinne: and he which preſumeth to of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer him againe, is an enemy to the Croſſe of Chriſt, trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth the Son of God vnder his foot, counteth the blood of the new Teſtament vnholy, and hath renounced ſaluation by Ieſus Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Now if we cleauing preciſely to the inſtitution of Chriſt, doe not conſecrate: what may be thought of the popiſh Prieſts, who whiſper their words cloſely, that no man hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth? vſe a ſtrange tongue, that no man vnderſtandeth: bring in priuate Maſſes, whereat none communicate: deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer dry Communions, wherein no man drinketh: exhort no man, ſpeake to no man: and if they do conſecrate, they conſecrate onely for themſelues, &amp; not for others? Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we deteſt the opprobrious and blaſphemous ſpeeches of the prophane Papiſts, who in<note n="t" place="margin">2 Sam 16, 7. 2 King. 18, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Thus
<pb n="440" facs="tcp:21092:237"/> they ſpeake baſely, proudly, and ſcornefully of our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munions, but all the world knoweth they ſpeake vntruely. We hold an effectual conſecration in both the Sacraments, though we deny a reall conuerſion into the body &amp; blood of Chriſt: the water in baptiſme is no more common wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,<note n="u" place="margin">Gal. 3.27.</note> it is not void of a ſpirituall effect, it is not without grace and ſanctification. So the bread and wine are chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, not from one ſubſtance into another, but from one vſe to another; not in themſelues, but to vs: not in their owne nature, but in their end; and thus they are not the ſame they were before.</p>

We ſee in baptiſme, the water re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining and not vſed, is no part of the Sacrament, but may be applyed to common vſes. So it is in the Lords Supper (for the Sacraments of the new teſtament are alike and of the ſame worthineſſe) no more is conſecrated then is recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued and applied. This alſo is euident by<note n="d" place="margin">Num. 10, 10</note> the rocke in the wilderneſſe: where the waters flowing from thence, repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented the blood of Chriſt to the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> that drank ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, not to the beaſts and cattell that were watered by it. So much was conſecrated water as they receiued, not all the reſt. So when <hi>Iohn</hi>
                  <note n="e" place="margin">Mat. 3, 6.</note> baptized in <hi>Iordan,</hi> not all the Riuer but all that which was applyed was ſanctified. So when he baptized in<note n="f" place="margin">Ioh 3, 23.</note> 
                  <hi>Fnon,</hi> becauſe there was much water there, not the whole ſtreame was hallowed, but ſo much as he v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed.
<pb n="441" facs="tcp:21092:237"/> Wherefore, whatſoeuer remaineth after the cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bration of the Sacraments, may be applyed lawfully to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon and ordinary vſes, and therefore all ſuperſtition tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching any of them is to be auoyded.</p>

                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Vſe </seg>3</label> in the Sacraments or out of the Sacraments, be by the word and prayer, as appeareth by the Apoſtle: it teacheth a profitable inſtruction, namely, that no creature of God is to be receiued, no guift to be vſed, no bleſsing to be enioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, tending to the health of the body, or comfort of the ſoule, without this duty of prayer and thankſgiuing to the Lord. Indeed euery creature of God in it ſelfe is good, and euery guift is holy: yet if we partake them without praiſing the name of the giuer and creator, to vs they become vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holy, vncleane, and vnpure. Now if this be needful in vſing the common creatures and guifts of God: much more is it neceſſary in receiuing theſe pledges and ſeales of feeding our ſoules to eternall life. Behold heere the cauſe that mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued Chriſt when he had taken the bread, to giue thanks to his Father: wherein hee ſheweth what belongeth to the duty of the Miniſter and of the communicants, to wit, that we ought to lift vp our hearts to God, to praiſe him for gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing his onely begotten Sonne to be our redeemer, &amp; hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly to pray vnto him that our vnworthineſſe hinder not the effectuall working of his Sacraments, but that through his goodnes and mercy they may haue their full force in our hearts, for the pardoning of our ſinnes, for the increaſe of his graces, for the confirming of our faith, for the quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of our obedience, and for the preſeruing of body and ſoule to eternall life. Thus we bleſſe God when we praiſe him, and giue him the honour due vnto his name. Wee bleſſe the meates we eate, the drinkes we drinke, the things we receiue, as <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith,<note n="g" place="margin">1 Cor. 10, 16</note>

For heere are not bare ſignes, bare tokens, bare figures without fruite and without grace: they are conſecrated ſignes, and hallowed elements, effectually ſealing vp remiſsion of ſinnes. And what is more plaine then that which the Apoſtle teacheth, 1 Cor. 11.<note n="k" place="margin">1 Cor. 11, 25 26.</note> 
                  <hi>As often as ye ſhall eate of this bread, and drinke of this cup, ye ſhew the Lords death till he come?</hi> Thus the Lord Ieſus ſpeaketh, <hi>Doe this, as oft as ye ſhall drinke it, in remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of me.</hi> And haue we not many worthy and effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all<note n="l" place="margin">Reaſons re<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

It is the commandement of Chriſt, ſo that we ought to make ſome conſcience of this duty, as of other commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments preſcribed vnto vs. It is a commandement of God<note n="m" place="margin">Exo. 20, 13</note> 
                  <hi>Thou ſhalt not ſteale.</hi> Few but doe make ſome conſcience thereof, becauſe it is Gods commandement. So is this heere, often to come to the Lords Table: yet what little account is made heereof al the yeare long, euery one ſeeth, and the faithfull ſoule agreeueth. The high God poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſor<note n="n" place="margin">Gen. 14, 12.</note> of heauen and earth hath required and commanded it: yet who regardeth?

Againe, to his comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement he hath annexed a promiſe, which maketh our ſin and vnthankfulnes the greater, if wee ſhew not our ſelues ready in yeelding to this duty. Beſides, ſeeing this Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament is a ſpeciall prop to ſtay vp our ſaith, and bringeth with it Chriſt and al his merits and heauenly treaſures: we are vtter enemies to our owne ſelues, to our owne ſoules, and to our owne ſaluation, if we neglect ſo great mercy of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered vnto vs. Wherefore, it is not left free vnto vs, and committed to our diſcretion to receiue or not receiue, this were no lawfull liberty, but vnlawfull licentiouſneſſe.

<pb n="443" facs="tcp:21092:238"/> man that feeleth his ſicknes, and knoweth his owne weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, ſhould haue a ſpecial care to looke to his ſtomack, that thereby he may receiue nouriſhment and gather ſtrength: ſo we are all ſpiritually diſeaſed, aſſaulted of Sathan, temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of the fleſh, ouercome oftentimes of ſin, and muſt ſeeke ſtrength of faith from this heauenly nouriſhment. God of his compaſsion: hath ſet vp his Sacrament as a ſigne vpon an high hill, whence it may be ſeene farre and neere on euery ſide, to raiſe vp ſuch as are fallen, to ſtrengthe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſuch as ſtand, to comfort ſuch as are weake, and to call vnto him ſuch as run away from him, whereby he gathereth them vnder his wings. It is as the brazen Serpent,<note n="p" place="margin">Num. 23, 9.</note> that comming vnto it with a faith to be healed, we might liue and not periſh. It is as a banner diſplayed, that euery Chriſtian Souldior ſhould reſort vnto it as vnto his owne colours, to fight the battels of God againſt ſin and Sathan. It is as a royal feaſt of the great King, whereunto we muſt go cheerefully, as gueſts inuited to a comfortable ſupper, to bee had in often vſe and continuall remembrance, to put vs in minde of his continuall mercy laid vp for vs in the blood of Chriſt, and to ratifie and ſeale vp the ſame farre more liuely then the bare word onely.</p>
               <p>When the words of Chriſts inſtitution are ſpoken,<note n="q" place="margin">Mat. 26, 26.28.</note> 
                  <hi>This is my body which is broken for you: this is my blood which was ſhed for you:</hi> When theſe words, I ſay, are read vnto vs out of the Scriptures, they confirme our ſaith: but much more when the Sacrament is ſeene with our eyes, that we behold the bread broken and looke vpon the wine poured out: but moſt of all when we taſte and handle, when we eate and drinke the outward ſignes. Wee ſee when one maketh a bare promiſe to another, with words onely betweene the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, hee beginneth to doubt (to whom the promiſe is made) of the performance thereof: if he adde an oath for confirmation, the promiſe is more aſſuredly ratified: but if he giue his hand writing and ſeale it to the party, the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter is made out of doubt. Thus we doe reaſon and helpe our faith. We haue the promiſes of God, we haue the oath of God, we haue the words and writings of God, we
<pb n="444" facs="tcp:21092:239"/> haue the ſeales and Sacraments of God, theſe are not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerued in the Lords keeping, but are put into our owne hands to ſee them, to keepe them to vſe them for our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort and aſſurance. I ſpeake after the manner of men, if we haue a free promiſe from an honeſt man, penned fairely in writing, ratified vnder his owne hand and ſeale, and all giuen vnto vs to locke and lay vp, we doubt not of the poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſsion, nor of our iuſt title vnto the ſame.</p>
               <p>Now let vs conſider the Lords doing, and ſee what hee hath done for vs: who is not as man, that<note n="r" place="margin">Num. 23.</note> he ſhould lye, nor as the ſonne of man that he ſhould deceiue. God ſent his Sonne<note n="ſ" place="margin">Gal. 4, 4.</note> into the world to take our nature vpon him, to be like vs,<note n="t" place="margin">Heb. 4:15.</note> euen in his infirmities he named himſelfe<note n="u" place="margin">Mat. 1, 21.</note> Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus, that is, a Sauiour, becauſe hee ſhould ſaue his people from their ſinnes: after his death he ſent his Apoſtles to preach the glad tidings of remiſsion of ſinnes and euerlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſaluation: he ordained his laſt Supper immediately be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his death to teſtifie and aſſure them vnto vs, not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by ſounding them in our eares, but by beholding, ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting, ſmelling, feeling, and feeding to ſeale them in our hearts, and alſo daily to be repeated and miniſtred vnto vs. Seeing then we haue both his promiſes and oath, his word and writings, his ſeales and Sacraments in our keeping; what would we haue more? He would not make halfe ſo much ado in aſſuring his promiſes, if hee loued vs not: he would not ſet ſuch authentike ſeales to his deed and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligations, vnleſſe he meant good earneſt. His bare word and naked promiſe is very good payment: but he reſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth our weakneſſe, whoſe mercifull kindneſſe muſt not bee neglected through our vnthankfulnes.

                  </note> they ſignifie vnto vs. Theſe inward parts are foure in number, to wit, firſt the Father, ſecondly the Spirit, thirdly the body and blood of Chriſt, and fourthly the faithfull. All theſe haue a ſacramentall relation to the outward parts, and declare the inward truth of them. The actions of the Miniſter are notes of the actions of God the Father: the word of inſtitution is made effectuall by the holy Spirit: the bread and wine are ſignes and ſeales, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſenting the body and blood of Chriſt: the outward ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of euery receiuer do note out the inward actions and ſpirituall workes of the faithfull. Thus then the agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment anſwereth aptly, and the proportion falleth fully be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene the parts.<note n="c" place="margin">The agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t between the outward and inward parts.</note> As the Miniſter by the words of inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion offereth vnto the Communicants the bread and wine to feed thereupon corporally and bodily: ſo God the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by the Spirit offereth and giueth the body and blood of Chriſt, to the faithfull receiuers to feed vpon them ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually. Hence it is, that the outward actions of the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters, and the outward actions of the receiuers are ſaid to be ſignes of the ſecond kinde, and therefore may fitly bee called parts of the Supper.</p>
               <p>Now then, let vs remember the ſenſible and externall actions of the Miniſter, that thereby we may conſider the ſpirituall and inward actions of God the Father. And firſt of all, the taking of the bread and wine into his hands, and the conſecrating or bleſsing of them by repeating the promiſe, by prayers, and thankſgiuings, doth ſeale vp theſe holy actions of God the Father, by which he from all eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity euen before the foundation of the world, did ſeparate, elect, ordaine, chuſe, and call his Sonne to performe the office of a Mediator betweene God and man: and when the fulneſſe of time came did ſend him into the world, to performe that office, whereunto he was appointed, This wee ſee proued vnto vs in many places, as <hi>Iohn</hi> 6. <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour not for the meate which periſheth, but for the meate that en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dureth vnto euerlaſting life, which the Sonne of man ſhall giue

                  <note n="e" place="margin">Gal. 1, 4.</note> 
                  <hi>according to the will of God euen our Father:</hi> So that what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer Chriſt did, he did it by the will and appointment of his Father. According to the teſtimony of the Apoſtle, Heb. 5. Chriſt tooke not to himſelfe this honor, to be made the High Prieſt,<note n="f" place="margin">Heb. 5, 5.</note> but he that ſaid vnto him, <hi>Thou art my Sonne, this day I begat thee, gaue it him.</hi> And as the Father ordained him to that office, ſo in time he ſent him, as the Euangeliſt witneſſeth,<note n="g" place="margin">Luke 4, 18.</note> 
                  <hi>The Spirit of the Lord is vpon me, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he hath annointed me, that I ſhould preach the Goſpell to the poore, binde vp the broken hearted, preach liberty to the cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiues, &amp;c.</hi> So likewiſe 1 Ioh. 4. <hi>Heerein is that loue, not that we loued God, but that he loued vs, and</hi>

               <p>Thirdly, by theſe outward actions of the Miniſter, we <label type="milestone">

We muſt not wander and gaze about, and thinke we haue nothing to do, but when we take and receiue the bread and the cuppe into our hands: we muſt in euery ſacramentall rite conſider the things ſignified, and ponder in our hearts the fitneſſe and agreement betweene them both. So then, as we behold with our bodily eyes the Miniſter (repreſenting the perſon of the Father) taking, bleſsing, and ſeparating the bread and wine to that bodily vſe: ſo ſurely and certainely wee muſt learne that God the Father hath ordained and ſent his onely begotten Son<note n="o" place="margin">Mat. 17, 5. and 3, 17.</note> in whom he is well pleaſed, to be the Mediator for the pardon of our ſins. Hence we ſee the infinite loue of God toward vs, and let vs labour to comprehend<note n="p" place="margin">Eph. 3, 18.19.</note> the length, bredth, height, and depth thereof, that ſpared not his own Sonne,<note n="q" place="margin">Rom. 32.</note> but gaue him for vs all vnto the death: hence we ſee that exceeding compaſsion of the Son, that loued his enemies more then himſelfe, and accounted not his owne life pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious to himſelfe: hence we ſee the gracious and glorious worke of our redemption, wherein the mercy and iuſtice of God<note n="r" place="margin">Pſal. 85, 10.</note> meete together, and kiſſe each other, teaching vs to take ſweet delight and comfort in the meditation thereof day and night with all thankſgiuing: hence wee haue aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of ſaluation and conſolation in all troubles and ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations: hence we ſee the greatnes of our owne ſinnes that could not be pardoned, but by the death of the Son of god, and therefore we muſt hate them with an vnfained hatred as our greateſt, moſt dangerous and deadly enemies: and laſtly, hence we ſee, that if God the Father thus loued vs, we ought earneſtly to loue him againe, and to ſerue him in all duties of holineſſe and true righteouſneſſe: neither
<pb n="448" facs="tcp:21092:241"/> ought we to loue him onely, but for him all our brethren, as the Apoſtle reaſoneth,<note place="margin">1 Ioh. 4, 11.</note> 
                  <hi>Brethren, if God ſo loued vs, wee ought to loue one another.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus we haue ſhewed, how the taking of the bread by the Miniſter, ſignifieth the Fathers appointing of his Son: the Miniſters bleſsing, the Fathers ſeparating and ſetting apart his Sonne to his office: the Miniſters deliuering of the bread, the Fathers giuing of his Sonne. If then wee draw neere to the Lords table with faith, reuerence, and repentance, nothing can be more ſure and certaine to vs, then the taking and receiuing of Chriſt, for when we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue the bread from the Miniſter, wee withall receiue the body of Chriſt offered by the hand of God the Father, ſo that as we are aſſured of the one, we need not doubt of the other.</p>

<pb n="452" facs="tcp:21092:243"/> plainely, after what faſhion Chriſt may be ſaid to be preſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t with vs in his Supper, to wit, according as he communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth himſelfe vnto vs, which is to our ſpirits, not to our bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, and therefore his preſence is ſpirituall, and not cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall.

Shall not Chriſt then the Sonne of righteouſnes make vs truely partakers of his fleſh by the vnſearchable power of his Spirit, and the ſuperna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall guift of a liuely faith, who can as eaſily ioyne toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther things farre off, as thoſe that are nigh?

As the Apoſtle tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth, <hi>That which we haue ſeene and heard, declare wee vnto you, that ye may alſo haue fellowſhip with vs, and that our fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip alſo may be with the Father, and with his Sonne Ieſus Chriſt.</hi> We ſee this likewiſe liuely laid out before vs in the eſtate of marriage, though the husband and wife be ſundred for a time and ſeparated one farre from another, yet the band of matrimony doth ſo ioyne and vnite them, that the wife is one fleſh with her husband, albeit he be a thouſand miles diſtant from her; ſo is it betweene Chriſt and the faithfull, he loued the Church and gaue himſelfe for it, and they are members of his body, of his fleſh, and of his bones, which coupling and combining together with Chriſt is wrought (as we haue ſhewed) by the Spirit principally, by faith in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrumentally, by both moſt effectually. Wee neede not therefore any carnall &amp; bodily preſence of Chriſt to ioyne vs to him, ſeeing it is truely and certainely performed by theſe meanes, whereby we grow to a perfect man in him. For as the Sunne is more comfortable to the world by his refreſhing beames and ſweete influence being abſent, then if his naturall body and compaſſe lay vpon the earth: ſo the fleſh of Chriſt being in the glory of his Father, much more comforteth and refreſheth our ſoules and bodies by his heauenly grace and ſpirituall influence, then if he were preſent fleſhly before our eyes. And as the Sunne, not diſcending from heauen nor leauing his place, is notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding preſent with vs in our Chambers, in our houſes, in our hands, and in our boſomes: ſo Chriſt being in the higheſt heauens, not comming downe, nor forſaking his

               <p>THe third inward part is<note n="a" place="margin">The third inward part of the Lords Supper, is the body &amp; blood of Chriſt.</note> the body and blood of Chriſt, that is, the body of our Lord deliuered vnto death for vs, and his blood ſhed for the remiſsion of ſinnes, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently whole Chriſt. This is the chiefeſt part of this Sacrament. For the body and blood of Chriſt ſignified by the bread and wine are thus made and ſeparated to bee the liuely meat of our ſoules, and haue that force and effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacy of feeding in our ſoules, which bread and wine haue in our bodies. This is the cauſe why<note n="b" place="margin">Ioh. 6, 48 50</note> Chriſt often calleth himſelfe the bread of life, Ioh. 6. <hi>I am that bread of life: this is that bread of life which commeth downe from heauen, that hee which eateth of it ſhould not dye; I am that liuing bread, if any man eate of this bread, he ſhall liue for euer.</hi> Thus euery re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiuer is giuen to vnderſtand, that as God doth bleſſe the bread and wine in his Supper, to preſerue, ſtrengthen, and comfort the body of the receiuer: So Chriſt apprehended and receiued by faith doth nouriſh vs, and preſerueth body and ſoule vnto eternall life. He dyed in the fleſh, that he might quicken vs: and he poured out his blood, that hee might clenſe vs from our ſinnes. Wherefore<note n="c" place="margin">How the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cramentall rites do ſerue to ſtrengthen our faith.</note> whenſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer as the Lords gueſts we ſee the bread on the Lords Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, we muſt ſet our mindes on the body of Chriſt: when we behold the cup of the Lord, we muſt thinke vpon the blood of Chriſt: when we looke vpon the bread broken, and the wine poured out, we muſt conſider how the body of Chriſt was pierced, puniſhed, cruſhed, crucified, torne, tormented, and his blood poured out for our ſakes: when we feele, that by bread our bodies are nouriſhed &amp; ſtreng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thened, and by the wine our vitall ſpirits are comforted &amp;
<pb n="455" facs="tcp:21092:244"/> refreſhed, we beleeue that by the body of Chriſt deliuered to death for vs, we are fed to euerleſting life, and that by his blood poured out vpon the Croſſe, our conſciences are ſanctified, and we feele his quickening power, which doth confirme vs in our communion with him. Thus is this part of the Supper ſpiritually to bee applyed: thus are the bread and wine made a Sacrament to vs, &amp; not bare ſignes: thus the memoriall of Chriſts death is repeated, which al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit it were once finiſhed on the Croſſe, and now his paſsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is paſt long ago: yet to the faithfull in regard of the force, it is ſtill freſh and alwaies preſent. Now it is not without cauſe and good conſideration, that Chriſt would haue the bread firſt deliuered as a ſigne of his body, &amp; then afterward the wine as a ſigne of his blood, ſeuerally and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part adminiſtred, becauſe his body and blood are not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented to vs, as his humanity now dwelleth glorious in the heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, but as he was offered vp a ſacrifice on the croſſe, his blood being ſhed out of his body. For to the ende it may be nouriſhment to vs, it muſt bee crucified. For as corne of it ſelfe is not fit food for vs, vnleſſe it be threſhed, winnowed, ground, and baked for vs: ſo is it touching Chriſt, he muſt ſuffer, be crucified, and dye, that wee may liue by him, and raigne with him.</p>

                  </note> the words of conſecration the bread and wine are aboliſhed, and the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy and blood of Chriſt come in place, ſo that they make them corporally preſent, not onely in the Sacrament to be eaten with the mouth, but in the pixe, in the Maſſe, and in their ſolemne proceſsions, where is neither eating nor drin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king. Yea <hi>Berengarius</hi> in his recantation was taught to ſay, and forced to ſubſcribe, that<note n="i" place="margin">De con diſt. <hi>2.</hi> ego Bereng.</note> 
                  <hi>Chriſt is in the Sacrament ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly (or ſenſually) is touched with the fingers, diuided, broken, &amp; rent with the teeth,</hi> and not onely the accidents.

Thus then the difference ſtandeth betweene vs, they hold that Chriſts body, and blood are carnally eaten of wicked
<pb n="457" facs="tcp:21092:245"/> men without faith, of brute beaſts without reaſon: but we deny that Chriſt is thus preſent in the Sacrament, for his body cannot be vnder ſo little a quantity of bread and wine: beſides, it is impiety to auouch that the perſon of Chriſt or his bodye and blood can be truely receiued of Dogges, Swine, and Mice, be chewed with the teeth, ſwal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed downe the throat, digeſted in the ſtomacke, and be caſt out into vncleane places. This we deny, this we do not beleeue, this we abhorre and deteſt from the bottome of our hearts. What is it then we teach and profeſſe? We de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny that the body and blood of Chriſt are carnally contai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned vnder the ſhewes and ſhaddowes of bread and wine: we deny them to be eaten and drunken of wicked men or vnreaſonable creatures: we deny that they are truely and properly both in heauen and on the earth, in pixes, and on the Altars. Theſe are<note n="k" place="margin">Aug tract. <hi>25</hi> in Iohan.</note> meate for the minde, not for the mouth: for faith, not for the teeth: for our beleefe, not for the belly: for the ſoule, not for the body. For this cauſe <hi>Chryſoſt. hom.</hi> 24. <hi>in</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> ſaith well, <hi>Vbi cadauer, ibi aquilae, &amp;c.</hi> that is, where the carkaſſe is, there are the Eagles: the carkaſſe is the Lords body, becauſe of his death: he calleth vs the Eagles, to ſhew that he muſt flye vp on high that will come neere to that body.</p>
               <p>This carnall eating of Chriſt is<note n="l" place="margin">Sundry rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons rendred to refel the real preſence.</note> confuted and conuin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced by many reaſons. Firſt, Chriſt ſate downe at the Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and the Diſciples with him, afterward he tooke bread, gaue thanks, brake it, gaue it, and ſaid, <hi>This is my body:</hi> likewiſe he tooke and gaue the cuppe and ſaide, <hi>Drinke yee all of this:</hi> whereby we ſee, when the Apoſtles receiued<note n="m" place="margin">Luk. 22, 19.</note> the Sacrament, Chriſt ſate at the Table with his true body: but the body which they tooke, ſate not at the Table, therefore they tooke the ſigne of his body. Likewiſe the blood which they receiued was not in the body which ſate at the Table, therefore it was not properly Chriſts blood which was not as yet really and actually ſhedde. The ſame body could not ſit at the Table, and not ſit at the Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble: the ſame body could not be in their hands, and out of their hands: the blood of Chriſt could not be out of his
<pb n="458" facs="tcp:21092:246"/> veines in the cup, and in his veines within his body: hee could not ſit viſible at the Table, and be inuiſible in the mouths and bellies of the Diſciples. Wherefore the reall prſence bringeth with it reall contradictions which cannot ſtand together.</p>
               <p>Secondly, the end of the Lords Supper, is to call his death to a continuall remembrance, as Luke 22. <hi>Do this in</hi>
                  <note n="n" place="margin">Luk. 22, 19.</note>

And to what purpoſe ſhould wee ſhew the Lords death till hee come, if he come daily and be preſent bodily in the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Beſides, the wiſeſt among the Philoſophers teach vs that<note n="o" place="margin">Ariſt. lib. de memoria.</note> ſence is of things preſent, but remembrance is of ſuch things as are abſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t: as hope is of ſuch things as are to come, not ſeene,<note n="p" place="margin">Rom. 8, 24.</note> and this the Apoſtle teacheth.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Chriſt receiued a true body with all the natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall properties of an humane body, like to vs in all things ſinne<note n="q" place="margin">Heb. 4, 15.</note> onely excepted, and is therefore called the ſonne of <hi>Dauid,</hi> the ſonne of <hi>Mary,</hi> the ſonne of man, our brother partaker of fleſh and blood, he is ſaid to haue taken vpon him the ſeede of <hi>Abraham,</hi> and not the Angels nature<note n="r" place="margin">Luk. 24, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

And if this were not a ſtrong reaſon, It is not felt and ſeene, therefore no humane body: the Diſciples might haue anſwered vnto Chriſt, why doeſt thou bid vs behold thy hands, and ſee thy feete, and handle thy body, and therby to try thy humanity, ſeeing thou haſt a body which cannot be ſeene, touched, or handled?</p>

               <p>Fiftly, Chriſt reproueth the Caparnaits, becauſe they thought his body was to be eaten in fleſhly manner, with the mouth of the body, &amp; ſhould deſcend into the ſtomack, which is the way that all other meates do paſſe: when they heard him preach of eating his fleſh &amp; drinking his blood, they ſaid,<note n="u" place="margin">Ioh. 6, 60.36.</note>

               <p>Now to ſhew<note n="a" place="margin">What it is to eate the body of chriſt ſpiritually.</note> what it is to eate ſpiritually, and to pull off the garment of this ſimilitude that the truth may more plainely appeare, by ſpiritual eating we do not vnderſtand, that which is fained, ſtanding in a conceit, opinion, or ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination; neither that the body and blood of Chriſt are turned into a ſpirit, but we meane by ſpirituall eating ſuch a communion and participation of Chriſt, as is wrought by the powerfull working of the Holy-Ghoſt, inaſmuch alſo as it is attained by faith onely, and pertaineth to a ſpirituall and eternall life. And howſoeuer the benefit of this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iunction reach vnto the body, which thereby is mortified, and ſanctified, and afterward ſhall be glorified: yet this fruition of Chriſt is not called corporall, but ſpirituall, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe this food doth not pertain to the maintaining of this preſent life, but it is referred to the life which is eternall. Now this life euerlaſting is called ſpirituall, albeit the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies themſelues ſhall be partakers thereof which therefore<note n="b" place="margin">1 Cor. 15, 44</note> by the Apoſtle are called ſpirituall bodies.

For we ſpeake not of the difference between Chriſts glorified and mortall body, but of the meaning of the words, <hi>This is my body:</hi> whether Chriſt vnderſtand his naturall and mortall body wherein ſhortly he was to be glorified, or whether he vnderſtand it of his body glorified? Either it muſt be vnderſtood of the one, or of the other, or of both: or rather indeed of nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, except they will haue the words taken and ſpoken one way to the Diſciples, and another way to vs. Thus the meaning of them when they were firſt vttered ſhould be, <hi>This is my mortall body:</hi> but now ſpoken to vs, they ſhould be taken in another ſenſe of vs to the end of the world, <hi>This

Againe, the circumſtances of the text, the nature of a Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and the Articles of our faith will not ſuffer vs to take them properly: beſides this, that they ſhould command vs an horrible and wicked thing, to eate mans fleſh, &amp; drinke his blood, and therefore when we are commended to eate his fleſh and to drinke his blood, it is a figure (as <hi>Auſtine,</hi> teacheth) requiring of vs to be partakers of his paſsion, &amp; to keepe in remembrance that his fleſh was crucified for vs.</p>
               <p>Moreouer, the Euangeliſts neuer ſay the bread is tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſubſtantiated into his body, or the wine into his blood, or that the body and blood of Chriſt are in the bread, or vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the bread, or with the bread: all the circu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſtances teach, that the bread is a Sacrament of his body, the wine is a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament of his blood, as circumciſion was a ſigne of the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenant, the lambe a ſigne of the Paſſeouer, the rocke a fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure of Chriſt.</p>

               <p>Thus many haue bin baptized, that were neuer regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated and inwardly purged,<note n="a" place="margin">Act. 8, 23.</note> appeareth in <hi>Symon</hi> the ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerer whoſe heart was not vptight, ſo that albeit he were

And therefore it is a ſure and certaine rule, that all things are not ſet downe in the old and new Teſtament in order as they were done; but oftentimes that is ſet downe after, which was done before; and before, which was done after, Beſides, after that the Supper was ended and a Pſalme ſung,<note place="margin">Mat. 26, 30.</note> Chriſt went out into the mount of Oliues; now if <hi>Iudas</hi> had ſtaied till the Supper had bin ended, he could not haue made ſuch preparation at a ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daine to get together thoſe that ſhould take Ieſus: for there came with him a great multiude with ſwords and ſtaues from the chiefe Prieſts and Elders of the people. The coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell and conuocation of the chiefe Prieſts, and the Scribes, and the Phariſies, and the Elders, and their ſitting in iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment determining what to do, required ſome time, and before <hi>Iudas</hi> could receiue a band of men from them, it muſt take vp more time: to omit the time ſpent in departing fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Chriſt and in returning vnto Chriſt againe, which could not be done ſpeedily, and therefore no doubt he was gone before. As then Chriſt bad him do quickly that which he did, ſo he ſtayed not, but was glad he was gone from his ſight and company.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, it cannot be but the guiltineſſe of the conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of <hi>Iudas</hi> did accuſe him and ſting him who had beene with the high Prieſts and couenanted with them to betray his Maiſter, eſpecially ſeeing Chriſt our Sauiour was euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more ſpeaking of it, and putting his Diſciples in minde that one of them ſhould betray him.<note place="margin">Ioh. 8, 7, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </note> It is noted touching the Scribes and Phariſies, that when Chriſt willed him that was without ſinne to caſt the firſt ſtone at her that was ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken in adultery, <hi>They being conuicted by their owne conſcience went out one by one, beginning at the eldeſt, euen vnto the laſt.</hi> So likewiſe he feeling an hell and horror in his conſcience, and knowing that (notwithſtanding his ſecret plotting) his diueliſh dealing was detected and his prophane heart eſpied, could not abide to haue his ſore touched, but no doubt made all haſt to be gone out of the ſight &amp; preſence of his Maiſter.</p>

The Arke was a teſtimony of Gods preſence, a witneſſe of his loue and league with man, and an aſſured ſigne that God would make his dwelling place among them, that he would abide with them, that he would walke before them, that he would be their gratious God, and that they ſhould be his people: but the Prieſts, Elders, and people, attributed ouermuch vnto it, and farre greater things then they ought, they ſaid,<note n="a" place="margin">1 Sam. 4, 3.</note>

Wherefore Chriſt cannot bee in vs, if we be not approued, but refuſed of God. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenthly, if ſuch as eate the bread of the Lord vnworthily, do withall eate the body of Chriſt, it will follow fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> hence, that to eate is no longer to eate, but to reiect and refuſe. For theſe two <hi>(take ye, and eate ye,)</hi> are ioyned together by Chriſt himſelfe: ſo that the eating it ſelfe is a kinde of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiuing.

This is the right vſe, this is the true end, this is the ſound comfort following and flowing from the death of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>To conclude, we muſt learne and hold for euer, that wee haue the beginning and chiefe cauſe in our ſelues, which did crucifie Chriſt and cruſh him with moſt bitter ſorrows: let vs then be reuenged of our ſins, and do al deſpite we can vnto them: let vs endite them, arraigne them, accuſe them, condemn them and naile them to his croſſe: let vs kill them, mortifie them, and bury them in his graue for euer. This is the firſt end of the ſupper, which is ſignified by the brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of the bread and powring out of the wine, declaring vnto vs, that as the body of our Lord was broken, and by violent meanes afflicted, ſo his bloud guſhed out and flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wed plentifully out of his gaping and bleeding woundes. This muſt be our meditation whenſoeuer wee come to the Lords table.</p>
               <p>For the paſsion of Chriſt, as the breaking of his body vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon the croſſe, the powring out of his bloud, and the ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rating of the Soule from the body, muſt be both ſpoken of by the Paſtor, and remembred by the receiuer in the Supper if the one would deliuer it faithfully, and the other receiue it fruitfully. We muſt call to minde that Chriſt humbled himſelfe to death for vs, euen to the accurſed death of the croſſe, that hee apprehended and felte the whole wrath of God vpon him in Soule and body, whereby he was brought into a grieuous agony; his body being rent with nayles, beaten with ſcourges, pricked with thornes, pearced with a ſpeare, and his Soule preſſed with the burden of all our ſins which were caſt vpon his ſhoulders, he ſtanding as a pledge and ſurety in our places. What ſhall wee returne vnto him for this mercy, and what loue ought wee to render for this great loue? Shal we not cruſh the very head of ſin, that hath
<pb facs="tcp:21092:266"/> thus cruſhed our head? Let vs not therefore wound him that hath cured vs: nor pierce him with our ſinnes, that was killed for our ſins, or crucifie him by the luſts of the old man who was crucified to make vs newe men. And thus much of the firſt end of the Lords Supper.</p>

For wee take the bread in our hands, and likewiſe we take the cuppe into our hands as Chriſt commaunded, ſaying,<note n="b" place="margin">Mat. 26, 26.</note> 
                  <hi>Take ye, eate ye, drinke ye, deuide ye,</hi> Neither <hi>doe wee lay them apart, or hide them aſide, or reſerue them in a boxe, or abſtaine from them:</hi> but when we haue taken them, we eat them, we digeſt them, we are nouriſhed by them, and they are turned into our ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance. So Chriſt, being eate<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the godly by ſaith, is vnited to them by his ſpirit (as wee haue ſhewed before) whereby they are made one with Chriſt and he one with them. And as meate plentifully prepared, daintily dreſſed, and onely ſeene vpon the table, doth not nouriſh the body, or take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way hunger: ſo if the Goſpell be preached, and the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments adminiſtred, except we apply the promiſes of the goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell, and beleeue that Chriſt with all his guifts is ours, they profite nothing towards our ſaluation. Such therefore as lawfully and worthily come to the Lords Supper, as to a table richly furniſhed, and to a banket liberally prouided, muſt not onely generally beleeue that Chriſt ſuffered in the fleſh and dyed for ſinners, but<note n="c" place="margin">Gal. 2, 20</note> particularly for themſelues, yea communicateth himſelfe and all his guifts vnto them
<pb n="500" facs="tcp:21092:267"/> aboundantly, as certainely as themſelues eate of the bread and drinke of the cup.</p>
               <p>This vnion and communion is neere, and wonderfull great: and therefore the Apoſtle fitly calleth it a myſtery, euen<note n="d" place="margin">Eph. 5, 32.</note> 
                  <hi>a great mystery,</hi> ſpeaking of Chriſt &amp; of the Church. For what vnion can be greater then that which is betweene the thing nouriſhing, and the thing nouriſhed? We haue nothing in <hi>Adam,</hi> but that which conueyeth death vnto vs: ſo that it is needfull to be ioyned to one which may giue life to vs, that as we dye in <hi>Adam,</hi>
                  <note n="e" place="margin">Rom. 5, 19.</note> ſo we may liue in him. This vnion cannot by reaſon be expreſſed, or fully vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood. As Chriſt in the daies of his fleſh, had a double kindred, one earthly and carnall kinred, the other ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall, that by faith receiued his word, and beleeued in his name, of whom he ſaid,<note n="f" place="margin">Mat. 12, 44.</note> 
                  <hi>Behold my mother and my brethren; for whoſoeuer ſhall do my Fathers will, which is in heauen, the ſame is my brother, ſiſter, and mother:</hi> ſo is it in this vnion and fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowſhip with him, one is outward &amp; bodily, which al man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kinde hath with him, in that he is partaker of our fleſh and blood, the other inward &amp; ſpirituall, whereby we are made partakers of him and of all his ſauing graces to euerlaſting life. As Chriſt was borne of the Virgin Mary &amp; vnited our nature to him, taking vpon him,<note n="g" place="margin">Heb. 2, 16.</note> not the Angels nature, but the ſeed of <hi>Abraham,</hi> euery reprobate hath this vnion with him, in that hee tooke vpon him the ſhape of a man: but there is a myſticall and maruellous vnion, whereby he dwelleth in vs by faith, whereby we are truely coupled to him, made partakers of him, deliuered from ſin, and made heires of euerlaſting life, quickning and ſuſtaining vs, as food which preſerueth the life of the body. If the arme ioyned to the body haue no life, no ſence, no benefit of vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall ſpirits, it is no part of the body, though it be vnited to it: ſo the wicked liuing without faith, are as it were ſence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe, they haue no forgiueneſſe of ſinnes, no ſanctification, no ſaluation, and therefore are no true members of Chriſt. If he poure not life and grace into them, they are not his members: if he kill not ſinne in them, they are not vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted ſpiritually vnto him. The bodily vnion with him
<pb n="501" facs="tcp:21092:267"/> ſhall profite nothing: it is the Spirit that giueth life.</p>
               <p>Seeing then the receiuing of the bread and wine which <label type="milestone">

For euen as the wife ioyned to her husband in marriage, is thereby made partaker of his body and goods, hath intereſt with him in the commodities of this life,<note n="g" place="margin">Gen. 20.16.</note> and looketh for nouriſhment, food, fellowſhip, protection, and gouernment from him: ſo being made one with Chriſt, we are indued with his hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly guifts and bleſsings. This muſt be our comfort in all dangers and tentations in all tryals and aſſaults, to conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der that we are one with Chriſt, we are not onely deare vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him, but neerely ioyned with him, as members to the head, as the wife to the husband, and as the branches to the vine, and therefore can neuer be ſeparated from him in life or death. We haue in him a communion of goods, ſo that as he hath taken vpon him our ſinnes and the puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of them, ſo he hath againe communicated to vs his righteouſneſſe and life, and we may through his free guift challenge as our owne whatſoeuer is his.</p>
               <p>We ſee in the corporall marriage, ſo long as one is rich, the other cannot be poore. The Lord is our ſhepheard,<note place="margin">Pſal 23, 1.</note> what then can we want? Chriſt Ieſus is rich to all that cal vpon him, he is become all things vnto vs; the light by which we ſee: the life by which we liue: the way wherein we muſt walke: the doore by which we muſt enter: the garment which we muſt put on: the food whereby we muſt be nouriſhed and ſtrengthened. Of our ſelues we are void of all good things. We liue in darknes and in the ſhad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow of death: we are borne dead in ſinnes and treſpaſſes: we wander wide out of the way: we haue no entrance into Gods kingdome: the ſhame of our nakedneſſe appeareth to the loathing of our perſons.</p>
               <p>But through CHRIST IESVS, both theſe defects are taken away, and all the merits of his paſsion are made

               <p>And if we would farther conſider the neceſsity of this examination: we ſhould finde it ſtandeth vpon many ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient<note n="g" place="margin">Reaſons of this duty of examination.</note> reaſons and cauſes as vpon certaine foundations that cannot be remoued. Do we not ſee men when they come into the preſence of ſome honourable and noble perſon,<note n="h" place="margin">Gen. 41, 14.</note> to addreſſe themſelues to do it with all reuerence? <hi>Ioſeph</hi> being ſent for, to come before <hi>Pharaoh</hi> King of <hi>Egipt</hi> ſhaued his head, and changed his rayment: and Prou. 23. <hi>When thou ſitteſt downe with a Ruler at meate, conſider diligently what is before thee.</hi> Therefore when we ſit at the Lords Table to ſup with him, and are admitted to be his welcome gueſts: we ought much more to be carefull to ſanctifie our ſoules with all ſolemnity. Conſider with me a little our owne practiſe. We will not put our ordinary meates in a diſh vnwaſhed, nor our common drinks into a cup vncleanſed: and ſhall wee put the ſignes of bread and wine which are choſen inſtruments to conueigh Chriſt vnto vs, into vnſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified ſoules, vnprepared hearts, and filthy conſciences? Doth not our Sauiour Chriſt reproue ſuch hypocriſie, when he ſaith,<note n="i" place="margin">Mat. 16, 3.</note> 
                  <hi>Ye can diſcerne the face of the skie, and can you not diſcerne the ſignes of the times?</hi> And if that vpper chamber, where the Supper was firſt adminiſtred, were trimmed and garniſhed: ſhould not our hearts bee prepared, into the which it is receiued? Shal Chriſt himſelfe offer to come in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to our houſes: and ſhall not we ſanctifie our hearts to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertaine ſuch a gueſt? This were too great careleſnes and contempt.</p>
               <p>Moreouer, waigh with me the profit that commeth to our ſelues to moue vs to this examination. The comfort is great, the fruite is excellent, the benefit is vnſpeakeable to
<pb n="510" facs="tcp:21092:272"/> thoſe that partake the myſtery of the Supper worthily, they receiue Chriſt they receiue remiſsion of ſins, they receiue ſaluation, they receiue aſſurance of eternall life. For, if the woman diſeaſed <note n="l" place="margin">Math. 9, 20.</note> with an yſſue of blood, loe twelue yeare, comming behind Chriſt, and touched onely the hemme of his: garment, was made vvhole; then aſſuredly the ſpiritual receyuing of the body and bloode of Chriſt ſhall not bring leſſe profit, if the faith be equall, which notwithſtanding is wholy loſt without preparation. Ponder with me alſo how by neglect of this triall of our ſelues, not onely this profite is loſt, but the Sacrament it ſelfe is after a ſort defiled. For, howſoeuer it be in it ſelfe by the ordinance of God an holy and heauenly banquet, yet vnto the vngodly, vnregenerate and vnſanctified, it becommeth vnholy and wholy earthly,<note n="l" place="margin">Hag. 2.14.</note> as the prophet Haggai teacheth, Chapter 2. <hi>If a polluted perſon touch an holy thing it ſhall be vncleane.</hi> The perſon muſt be holy that will haue ſound profite by the holie things of God: the man that is vnholie, defileth euery thing he tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth, the polluted perſon polluteth all thinges. For as to<note n="m" place="margin">Tit. 1, 15.</note> the pure all things are pure, but vnto them that are defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led and vnbeleeuing is nothing pure, but euen their minds and conſciences are corrupted: ſo the prophane perſon de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fileth all thinges, and turneth wholeſome meate into noy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome poiſon. We muſt therefore vſe ſanctifyed things with ſadctifyed hearts: and for ſpirituall meate wee muſt haue ſpirituall veſſels.</p>
               <p>Furthermore, marke the great danger &amp; puniſhment that is procured and purchaſed by the want of preparation. For the vnworthy receiuer is guilty<note n="n" place="margin">1 Cor 11, 27</note> of the body and blood of Chriſt, as the Apoſtle ſpecifieth 1 Cor. 11. <hi>Whoſoeuer ſhal eat this bread and drinke the cup of the Lord vnworthily, ſhalbe guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the body and blood of the Lord.</hi> And againe, <hi>He that eateth and drinketh vnworthily, eateth and drinketh his own iudgment, becauſe he diſcerneth not the Lords body: for this cauſe many are ſicke and weake among you, and many ſleepe.</hi> Where he teacheth that ſuch as come vnworthily, vnreuerently, and otherwiſe then ſuch myſteries ſhould be handled, do deſpiſe &amp; tread vnder their feete Ieſus Chriſt himſelfe, prouoke the Lords
<pb n="511" facs="tcp:21092:272"/> wrath, and bring on themſelues ſwift damnation. Not that be is carnally and bodily preſent, but becauſe the reproach which is vſed to the ſignes, toucheth the bodie and bloode of Chriſt ſignified by them. Euen as if a man ſhoulde rent, diſgrace, deface, ſpit vppon, treade and trample vnder his feete, and villanouſlie abuſe the image, ſeale, and letters pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents of a Prince, he ſhould be adiudged <note n="d" place="margin">Ren. Iaeſae Maieſtatis.</note> guiltie of a gree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uous crime againſt the perſon of the Prince himſelfe, not which hee receyueth but deſpiteth: ſo, ſuch as come vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thankefully and vnworthily to this ſupper, are guiltie of his body, not which they haue eaten, but which they haue re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed and reiected being offered vnto them, and therefore are guilty of their owne death, inaſmuch as God with the ſignes offereth his owne Son.</p>
               <p>Wherefore ſeeing the preſence of God mooueth, ſeeing our owne profit perſwadeth, ſeeing our owne practiſe fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thereth, ſeeing the defiling of the Sacrament, and the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of vnwoorthy receiuing teacheth, and laſtly ſeeing our owne iudgement in humane affayres (when the daunger is not ſo great, nor the loſſe ſo certaine) cryeth out for this neceſſary preparation, it ſtandeth vs vpon, before wee en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter into this holy worke (whereunto of our ſelues wee are more vnfit and vnto warde, and which in it owne nature is moſt profitable) to ſet our ſelues before the Lord, who ſhal examine and iudge the quicke and the dead: to ſearch into our owne waies, and to keepe a ſeſſions in our owne ſoules: to looke into our ſecret and hidden corruptions, how wee haue gone forward or backeward in godlineſſe: to try whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther wee haue a knowledge, feeling, and diſliking of our ſinnes, and whether we haue any feare of Gods iudgments, or faith in his promiſes, or hope in his mercie: to iudge our ſelues, that we may not be iudged of the Lorde: to la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour to finde our ſpeciall ſinnes, ſtriuing againſt them by earneſt prayer to God, and condemning them for euer in our ſelues.

The more we perceiue and diſcerne our owne vnworthines, the greater ſhall be our fitnes to come to this Sacrament: and the leſſe we eſpy our owne imperfections, the more we incurre the danger of Gods iudgements. So then to touch vs with true humility, and to breake our ſtony hearts in pieces with remembrance of our daily offences, let vs often meditate on the death and paſsion of Chriſt, who was forſaken, ſcor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, buffetted, and crucified for vs: he was led as a lambe to the ſlaughter and ſhunned not the ſhame of the Croſſe: then the powers of heauen and earth were moued,<note n="p" place="margin">Mat, 27, 45</note> 
                  <hi>Iudea</hi> was darkened, the earth quaked, the ſtones claue in ſunder the graues opened, the Sunne was in the ful-moone eclip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, the vaile of the Temple was rent, the dead were raiſed, the theefe repented, the Centurion glorified God, and the whole order of nature was changed. All theſe things doe ſet before vs the heinouſneſſe of our ſins, and the greatnes of Gods wrath, which could not be appeaſed, but by cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying of the body and by ſhedding of the blood of Chriſt, which is repreſented to vs as in a glaſſe in this Supper. Thus we haue ſhewed by teſtimonies and effectuall reaſons, that as in the Paſſeouer they were commanded to chuſe them a lambe<note n="q" place="margin">Exod 12, 3.</note> on the tenth day, but to kill him on the fourteenth, ſo that they had foure dayes liberty betweene the ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting and the killing of him, for preparation and ſanctifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of themſelues: in like manner in the Supper, which is the ſame to vs, that the Paſſeouer was to the <hi>Iewes,</hi> the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of God chargeth this duty vpon vs, that we prepare our hearts reuerently thereunto.</p>

But if the rule be vnknowne, the tryall ſpoken oft cannot be made, the examination commanded cannot bee

                  </note> we ſhall plainely ſee the truth of this diuerſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. For in Baptiſme the action of the Miniſter is to waſh the body with water, which requireth not diſcretion in him that is to be baptized, foraſmuch as we can clenſe and waſh the things that are without reaſon, without vnderſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſenſe, and without life. But in the Sacra. of the Supper, a reuerent giuing, an attentiue hearing, a certaine vnderſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of that which is ſpoken, a wiſe receiuing and eating, &amp; a careful conſidering of whom to take, &amp; what to take is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired in the outward worke: how much greater iudgment is required, to know that God the father giueth the body &amp; blood of his Son to be receiued by faith? Thus the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aminatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> maketh a diſtinctio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> between both the Sacraments of the new teſtament, &amp; ſheweth, that it is not neceſſary to the ſaluation of infants, that they come to the Lords table.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, ſeeing no man muſt preſume to come thether without a ſerious examination of himſelfe:<note n="d" place="margin">Sixe ſorts of perſons bar<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>red from the Lord, ſupper</note> it debarreth <label type="milestone">

Firſt of all, ſuch as are not yet entred into the church by baptiſme, whatſoeuer their kno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and faith is, cannot claime any priuiledge or right to this Sacrament. Secondly, if there be a neceſſity of ſearch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and trying our ſelues, it excludeth all Infants and chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren in age, who vnderſtand not what the holy Spirit ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth in this Sacrament, what God the Father offereth, what the Son performeth, &amp; what faith receiueth, they know not what it is to eate Chriſt ſpiritually, and to be nouriſhed by him effectually. Thirdly, all fooliſh, furious, and mad-men, being ſuch idiots as that they want the vſe of naturall gifts of reaſon, wit, diſcretion, and iudgement, the defect wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, whatſoeuer they are in age and yeares, maketh them as children in gifts, not being able to examine themſelues, are to be ſeparated.

<pb n="515" facs="tcp:21092:274"/> doctrine of the Sacraments, and other fundamentall points of religion, they are not to be admitted but refuſed. Fiftly, if they haue al theſe things, and want neither baptiſme, nor ripeneſſe of age, nor yeares of diſcretion, nor vſe of reaſon, nor knowledge of the doctrine which is according to god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lines: yet if they remaine prophane, vngodly, vnrepentant, ſtubborne, malicious, reuenging, open contemners of God, of godlineſſe, and of his word, Idolaters, adulterers, blaſphemers, drunkards, and ſuch in whom appeareth no amendment of life, theſe and ſuch like are not intereſſed in this Sacrament. Laſtly, it excludeth &amp; ſhutteth out all ſuch as are without God in the world, al <hi>Atheists, Infidels, Turks, Iewes,</hi> and <hi>Hereticks,</hi> all ſuch as haue not yeelded themſelues to the Church of God, &amp; haue not made profeſsion of their faith, and ſuch as are worthily excommunicated from the Church by the power of the keyes, which are no better the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> heathen &amp; Publicans.

For ſuch as haue not the Church to be their mother, cannot be nouriſhed with this meate of the Church, to wit, the Supper of the Lord. Among all theſe that are thus exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, we do not name the hypocrite, becauſe his wickednes is in his heart and kept ſecret to himſelfe and therefore the Church can take no notice of him, but leaueth him to God, who ſearcheth the heart and trieth the raines.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, if all perſons are to prepare themſelues to this <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Vſe </seg>4</label> Sacrament: then none are willingly and wilfully to abſtain and refraine from comming vnto it.

For he lyeth vnder an heauie<note n="e" place="margin">Ier 48, 10.</note> curſe deſeruedly, that doth any of the Lords workes neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligently.

And this is the very cut-throat of al godlines &amp; reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion. For why doe they not, by like proportion of reaſon, refrain from inuocation and calling vpon the name of God, for feare of praying amiſſe? And why may they not abſent themſelues from hearing the word of God, fearing to heare amiſſe? So that if this pretence were a lawful warra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t to ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaine from the Lords Supper for feare of vnworthy recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing, we might bid all godlines farewell, in as much as it o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peneth a gap for men to abſtaine from perfourming all du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of piety and godlines.

The Apoſtle in this place ſpeaketh of examination, not of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſsion: of prouing our ſelues, not of putting our ſelues to the proofe of others. The commandement of the Holy-Ghoſt, to confeſſe one to another, bindeth the Prieſt to confeſſe to the people, as well as the people to confeſſe to the Prieſt. And whereas the Euangeliſt declareth Math. 3.<note place="margin">Mat. 3, 6.

True it is, the Fathers ſpeake much and
<pb n="519" facs="tcp:21092:276"/> often of confeſsion, but they meane it either of ſuch con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſsion as is made to God, or of ſuch perſons as had openly fallen in time of perſecution, or of them that of their owne accord vncompelled, accuſed their owne weakeneſſe and purpoſe of ſhrinking backe, albeit they had not as yet fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len indeed. Now that it may be knowne that theſe things do not concerne vs, nor yet helpe our aduerſaries,<note place="margin">Diuers ſorts of confeſsion</note> I will ſet downe what confeſsion we hold, and how it is to bee made, and in what reſpect. Firſt, wee allow the publike confeſsion of the whole Church, confeſsing themſelues to be ſinfull before God, Neh. 9, 4.5, &amp;c. Secondly, wee hold the priuate confeſsion of euery one, powring out his owne heart before God in his priuate and ſecret prayers, Lu. 18.13. Thirdly, we maintaine the confeſsion made to the Church, when any perſon hath openly offended the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation by any notorious crime and is for the ſame ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicated. This doth teſtifie the conuerſion and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance of ſuch as haue fallen. Laſtly, we teach that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſsion ought to be made to our neighbour for the offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces which we commit one againſt another, when wee haue vpon any occaſion wronged and offended him: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore our Sauiour ſaith, Math 5.<note place="margin">Mat. 5, 23, 24.</note> 
                  <hi>If thou bring thy guift to the Altar and there remembreſt that thy brother hath ought againſt thee: leaue there thy guift before the Altar, and go thy way, firſt be reconciled to thy brother, and then come and offer thy guift.</hi> Theſe kindes of confeſsion we confeſſe and beleeue: but what maketh all this for the whiſpering confeſsion vſed in popery? and iudged to be neceſſary to ſaluation? A tirran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous law, binding vs to reckon vp euery one of our ſinnes in the eare of a Prieſt, as if forgiueneſſe of our ſinnes ſtood in this? Whereas we ſay and are not afraid to auouch, that this confeſsion preſſed vpon men to be made of all ſinnes to a popiſh Prieſt vpon paine of damnation is no better the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> another Inquiſition. Would wee then know what this ſhrift is? and how to eſteeme of it? and what effects it worketh? It is the mocking of God,<note place="margin">What popiſh ſhrift is.</note> the inuention of the diuell, the pride of the Clergy, the pick-purſſe of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, the racke of the Conſcience, the ſhame and reproach

It getteth a pardon for all that is paſt, it giueth free paſſage for ſuch as are preſent, and purchaſeth a priuiledge for them that are to come. Thus ſinne is made no ſin, it is a light matter, that no man need to trouble himſelfe for it, for aſmuch as the Prieſt may pardon him with a word ſpeaking.

So did Chriſt himſelfe, as appeareth in many places of the Goſpell. The Church was then full of ſcandals, as a body full of ſores, but becauſe he had no calling nor commiſsion to remedy thoſe euils, he choſe ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to ioyne himſelfe with the company of the wicked, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to ſeparate himſelfe from the Sacraments and other holy things. Thus it was with <hi>Simeon, Hannah, Zachary, Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zabeth,</hi> and other of the faithfull. There are two certaine rules, with which I will conclude: Firſt, that our being in company with the wicked, vnwillingly, not willingly: by compulſion, not by free election, ſhall not hurt vs. It is our delight in them, and deſire of them, and ſtriuing to be with them, that bringeth danger vnto vs: but if it be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt our will, there is no feare of being infected by them. The ſecond rule is this, that we are greatly hurt in our ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation, and wounded in our ſoules by ſeparation from the exerciſes of our religion, and therfore there is no iuſt cauſe why we ſhould leaue the fruite of the one for the preſence of the other. It is a part of Gods ſpirituall worſhippe to heare his word, and indeed one of the principall ſeruices we can performe vnto him, yet may a Chriſtian lawfully heare it where there are Infidels and vnbeleeuers, yea not onely communicate with them, but be glad that they will vouchſafe to communicate with vs. And touching ioyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in prayer, and participation of the Sacraments, if it were in our choyce and liberty to auoid them, wee might not ioyne with them, nor make one among them: but becauſe we haue no power nor authority to make any ſeparation, wee ought not to refuſe or renounce the ſeruice of God which is enioyned and commanded vnto vs: and let vs take heed, leaſt while wee go about to ſeparate our ſelues from the wicked, we ſeparate our ſelues from God himſelfe. For there is no man that forſaketh his worſhip, but after a ſort forſaketh God, ſeeing that to cleaue vnto him and not to his worſhippe is vnpoſsible, and to diuide betweene theſe which are alwaies ioyned together, is to turne him into an

Thirdly, to abhorre and deteſt our ſins, to hate them with an vnfained hatred as our deadly and moſt dangerous enemies, and to haue godly ſorrow for them which may cauſe repentance not to be repented of. Laſtly, to loue our brethren truely and ſincerely, yea euen our ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies. If we finde not theſe things in our ſelues, we muſt carefully vſe all holy meanes appointed for this purpoſe, to begin them in vs: otherwiſe our eſtate will prooue to be fearefull and dangerous. We muſt with all ſincerity, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, and zeale, vſe prayer, the word read and preached, conferrence, meditation, and ſuch like helpes as may fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther them in vs. If we do finde them in vs, though feeble and in great want and weakneſſe, we are not to abſtaine from the Sacrament, but to come therunto to ſeek ſtrength of faith and increaſe of obedience. Wherefore,<note n="b" place="margin">Mat. 11, 28<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

               <p>Touching the firſt, we are to obſerue,<note n="d" place="margin">The 1. part of examinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg of Gods word.</note> that ſuch as will come aright to the lords ſupper, muſt haue the knowledge of Gods word, which is the foundation and ground-worke of faith. Wee muſt know what to beleeue, and muſt learne the doctrine of ſaluation out of the Scripture. Our Sauiour Chriſt, in that heauenly prayer which hee made a little be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his paſsion, vſeth theſe words to his Father,<note n="e" place="margin">Iohn, 17, 3.</note> 
                  <hi>This is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal life to know thee to be the onely very God, and whome thou haſt ſent Ieſus Chriſt.</hi> We muſt know how miſerable all men are of themſelues, that we are ſeparated from god, the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of wrath by nature as wel as others, and the verie fire-brands of hell. They that want this knoledge, cannot iudge aright of the parts and vſes of this Sacrament, nor deſire this heauenly meate which nouriſheth to eternall life. So then, knowledge muſt neceſſarily go before faith: for it is the nature of faith to beleeue that which it knoweth, and therefore where there is ſmall knowledge, there can bee but little faith: and where there is no knowledge, there can be no faith: acording<note n="f" place="margin">Rom. 10, 17.</note> to the doctrine of the Apoſtle, <hi>Faith commeth by hearing, and hearing by the word of God.</hi> The know<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ledge required of vs when we approach to this Sacrament, ſtandeth in theſe two<note n="g" place="margin">What parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular pointes <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

In theſe two branches ſtandeth the firſt part of examination. And theſe two points are ſo neerely ioyned and knit together, that no man can thoroughly know God, vnleſſe he know himſelfe: and no man can haue the perfect knowledge of himſelfe, except he know God in whom<note n="h" place="margin">Acts 17, 28</note> he liueth, moo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth, and hath his being. Vnder theſe two heads, many par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular points are containd, neceſſary to be known of thoſe that offer themſelues to bee partakers of this Sacrament. Firſt, that there is onely one God, that hath made himſelfe knowne in three perſons,<note place="margin">Iohn 5, 7.</note> the Father, the Sonne, and the Holy-ghoſt. Secondly, that God made man and all other
<pb n="527" facs="tcp:21092:280"/> creatures good, and gouerneth all things well. Thirdly, man did fall through the enticement of the Deuill, and his own wilfull diſobedience in breaking the commandements of God. Fourthly, there are ten commaundements diuided into two tables: whereof the foure firſt commaundements concerne our duties to God, the ſixe laſt our duties toward our neighbour.

Eleuenthly touching prayer, wee haue a
<pb n="510" facs="tcp:21092:281"/> perfect platforme left vs by<note n="q" place="margin">Mat 6, 9.</note> Chriſt in the Goſpell, which containeth 6. petitions, the three firſt concerning the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of God, and the three laſt concerning the neceſsities of our owne bodies and ſoules. Twelfely, the Sacraments are another helpe to ſtrengthen and increaſe faith, which are outward ſignes and ſeales ordained of God, to aſſure vs that Chriſt &amp; all his ſauing graces are giuen vnto vs. Theſe are two in number. Baptiſme, the Sacrament of our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generation and new birth, aſſureth vs by the waſhing of water, that our ſins are forgiuen by the blood of Chriſt, &amp; we borne anew to God. The Lords Supper aſſureth vs, that by bread and wine giuen and receiued according to Gods ordinance, Chriſt is giuen vs to be our ſpirituall nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhment to euerlaſting life.</p>
               <p>Theſe grounds of religion muſt be knowne and vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood, that we may learne how wretched and miſerable we are by nature, and what remedy God hath ordained for our deliuerance. We ſhall neuer feele the ſweetneſſe of Gods mercy, vntill we finde the greatnes of our owne miſery. We ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not perceiue how greatly we ſtand in need of Chriſt, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till we know our owne wofull and wretched eſtate by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of ſin. Such then as are ignorant in theſe neceſſary points of Chriſtian religion, and eſpecially in the doctrine of both the Sacraments, can neuer come aright vnto them, can neuer ſhew forth the Lords death, can neuer diſcerne his body, but blindly run on to the danger of their owne ſoules. Wherefore it ſtandeth all men vpon, to deſire the ſincere milke of the word<note n="r" place="margin">Pet. 2, 10</note> that they may grow thereby, to ſeeke after knowledge, as for ſiluer, and after vnderſtanding as precious ſtones. A loathing ſtomacke neuer well di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſteth the meat that is put into it: and he that is full, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſeth the Hony-combe. What is the reaſon that they remaine blinde in the matters of God and their owne ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation, and as bruite beaſts in vnderſtanding? Surely, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they deſire not the wayes of God, they regard not his feare, they contemne knowledge, as <hi>Eſau</hi> did the bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, and the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> did their <hi>Manna.</hi> For no man true<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly deſired the knowledge of God and of godlineſſe vnfai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nedly,

               <p>This faith is not borne and bred with vs, but is vvrought in vs by the Holy-ghoſt,<note n="h" place="margin">2 Theſ. 3, 2.</note> who is therefore called <hi>The Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of Faith.</hi> Except he giue it, no man can haue it: it is natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral to vs to preſume on the one ſide, and to deſpaire on the other ſide: but to beleeue (which is ſeated in the middeſt) is ſupernaturall.

For in vaine we ſhall pretend knowledge, boaſt of faith, glory of repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, if we faile in duties toward our brethren. Firſt we muſt looke to be at peace with God, and to be reconciled to him. For we ſhall neuer be at peace with our brethren, except we be reconciled to God. The greateſt war is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene God and our owne ſoules, ſo that nothing can bring peace to vs, vntill we be at one with him: but when once we are at one with him, we ſhall quickly be at one with all others.

                  <hi>By this ſhall all men know that ye are my Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, if ye loue one another.

Our Sauiour Chriſt auoucheth this, Math. 18. in the parable of the lender that had many debters: he called them to<note n="e" place="margin">Mat. 18, 23</note> take an account of them, and forgiueth the debt, hauing com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſsion on him that was not able to pay: but when hee was departed, and had found one of his fellow-ſeruants which ought him an hundred pence, he laid hand on him, thratled him, and caſt him in priſon till he ſhould pay the debt. The<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Lord called him and ſaid, <hi>O euill ſeruant, I forgaue thee all that debt, becauſe thou prayedſt me: Oughteſt thou not alſo to haue pitty on thy fellow-ſeruant, euen as I had pitty on thee?</hi> So his Lord was wroth, and deliuered him to the tormenters, till he ſhould pay all that was due to him. Then followeth the application of the whole, <hi>So likewiſe ſhall mine heauenly

               <p>Heere we may ſee what manner of loue ought to bee in vs. Euery one of vs muſt endeuour that all the parts of this deſcription may rightly agree to euerie one of vs, and trulie be found in vs toward all men, euen our enemies, as we ſee Ieſus Chriſt hath left vs an example of his loue,<note n="m" place="margin">Luk. 23, 35</note> when hee prayed for his enemies, that crucified and cruelly entreated him <hi>father forgiue them for they know not what they do,</hi> and this did <hi>Stephe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

               <p>Thus we haue ſhewed the neceſsity of examination of our ſelues before we come to the Lords Supper, and declared the parts wherein it ſtandeth, and the manner how it is to be performed. If we come furniſhed with theſe things, with ſauing knowledge, with iuſtifying faith, with vnfained re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, with a louing and longing reconciliation toward our brethren among whom we liue, hauing as much<note n="n" place="margin">Rom. 12, 15.</note> as is poſsible, <hi>Peace with all men,</hi> yea euen our enemies: let vs not abſtaine from the Lords table, by reaſon of ſome fraileties and infirmities in vs: for God couereth them, <hi rend="sup">o</hi> and wil not bring them into remembrance, as we ſee 2 Chro. 30. <hi>A multitude of people had not clenſed themſelues, yet did eate the Paſſeouer, but not as it was written: wherefore Hezekiah prayed for them, ſaying, The good God be mercifull toward him that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pareth his whole heart to ſeeke the Lord God, the God of his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, though hee bee not clenſed according to the purification of the Sanctuary: and the Lord heard Hezekiah, and healed the people.</hi> Where we ſee, that becauſe their heart was vpright &amp; ſincere, their wants and imperfections were not imputed vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them.

               <p>THe effect of that which hath beene deliuered hitherto in theſe Bookes, may thus be gathered into a ſhort ſum and abridgement. We haue<note n="a" place="margin">The ſum of the firſt Book</note> declared that God in al times and ages of the Church, from the firſt being of our firſt pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, hath to his word and promiſes annexed Sacraments, as conduites of grace, and ſeales of aſſurance<note n="b" place="margin">Gen. 2, 9, &amp;c</note> for the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation of them, thereby magnifying his owne mercie toward his people, ſhewing our weakneſſe and vnworthy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and condemning ſuch as oftentimes deſire to come to the Lords Table, but eſteeme little of the preaching of the word, and ſuch as are diligent in hearing of the worde, but careleſſe in comming to the Sacraments, and manife<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting Gods goodneſſe to vs, in giuing vs ſuch helpes, as if a man ſhould put a ſtaffe in his hand that is weake and readie to fall: whereas the word and Sacraments haue one and the ſame Author, they are inſtruments of the ſame grace, their whole force &amp; effect dependeth on God, they require faith<note n="c" place="margin">Hebru. 4, 2.</note> to be mingled with them, and they profit not alway at the verie moment of hearing and receiuing. Notwithſtanding, ſome differences we finde betweene them, as namely in the greater neceſſitie of the word then of the Sacraments. Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dels were neuer barred from hearing the worde when they would become<note n="d" place="margin">1 Cor. 14, 24</note> hearers thereof; and whereas the word af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecteth one onely of the ſences, to wit, the hearing, the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments are offered to the eies as well as to the eares, and fo in ſome ſort become more effectuall then the word.</p>
               <p>Touching the word Sacrament, it is drawne from marti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all Diſcipline, and properly ſignifieth the Souldiers Oathe, whereby he bindeth himſelfe to his Captaine; which word being vſed by the old Latine Interpreter, is now beecome ordinary and common in the Church, which is not mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
<pb n="549" facs="tcp:21092:292"/> in ſo many Sillables in the Scriptures. And howſoeuer the word be often taken in a large and generall ſignificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, yet as we take it in theſe Bookes,<note n="e" place="margin">What a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament is.</note> a Sacrament is a viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ſigne and ſeale ordained of God, whereby Chriſt and al his ſauing graces by certaine outward rites are ſignified, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibited and ſealed vp vnto vs.</p>
               <p>This deſcription being receiued teacheth vs theſe points, firſt that the force of the Sacraments dependeth not on the worthineſſe or vnworthineſſe of the Miniſter, but vpon the ordinance of God,<note n="f" place="margin">Mat. 23, 2, 3.</note> ſo that an euill Miniſter may deliuer the good things of God. And this was the cauſe that<note n="g" place="margin">Iohn 4, 2.</note> Chriſt Ieſus baptized none, but his Diſciples baptized, that wee might learne not to eſteeme of the effect of the Sacraments, by the fitneſſe or vnfitneſſe of the Miniſters.</p>
               <p>Beſides, wee are admoniſhed heereby of the weakeneſſe of our Faith which needeth to be ſtrengthened: and this is the reaſon why ſo long as we liue in this world wee muſt vſe the Sacraments, becauſe our Faith is alwaies weak and vnperfect, and needeth helpes to further it, meanes to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe it, and proppes to ſtay it. And therefore the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle ſaith, 1 Cor. 11, 36. <hi>As often as ye eate this bread &amp; drinke this vp, ye do ſhew the Lords death till he come.</hi> Furthermore, we learn that there is no vſe of the Sacraments in the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of heauen, where all things are come to perfection: <hi>Now when that which is perfect is come,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 Cor, 13, 10.</note> 
                  <hi>then that which is in part ſhall be done away.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Againe,<note n="h" place="margin">Deutro 4, 2</note> none muſt adde vnto them, none muſt take ought from them, none muſt any way abuſe them, contrary to the inſtitution and ordinance of God. Laſtly, we learn from hence, that the Sacraments are not bare and naked ſignes of Chriſt abſent<note n="i" place="margin">1 Cor. 10, 16</note> but ſure and certain ſeales of Gods promiſes, and of the righteouſneſſe of Chriſt who is offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red vnto all, but receyued onely of the faithfull: ſo that the preſence of vngodly men meeting vs at the ſame Table, cannot any way hurt vs in our worthy receiuing. In a<note n="k" place="margin">In a Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der his Parts, and his Vſes.</note> Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament we are to conſider two thinges, his Parts and his Vſes.</p>
               <p>The parts of a Sacrament are<note n="l" place="margin">The partes are outwarde and inward.</note> partly outward and part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="550" facs="tcp:21092:293"/> inward. The outward parts are<note n="m" place="margin">The out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward parts of a Sacrament are foure, the Miniſter, the Worde, the Signe, the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceyuer.</note> theſe foure. Firſt, the Miniſter lawfully called, is neceſſarily required. If then the Miniſter will not adminiſter them, or if priuate perſons will adminiſter them,<note n="n" place="margin">Math. 28, 19</note> they ſinne againſt God, the one for not performing the duties of his calling, the other becauſe hee runneth beyond the bounds of his calling. The ſecond out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward part<note n="o" place="margin">Eſay 6, 6, 7</note> is the word of inſtitution, conſiſting of a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement and a promiſe: ſo that it is required of vs to vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand the words of inſtitution, to ioyne the worde with the Sacraments, and to diſcharge thoſe from the number of Sacraments, which want the warrant of the word.</p>
               <p>The third outward part of a Sacrament is<note n="p" place="margin">Marke 1, 5.</note> the ſigne: for whereſoeuer there is a Sacrament, there muſt of neceſſity be an outward element, ſo that neyther muſt wee make an I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doll of the Signe by aduancing it too high, nor cleane abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh it as the Church of Rome dooth by their doctrine of Tranſubſtantiation. The laſt outward part is the<note n="q" place="margin">Gene. 17, 12</note> Receiuer: ſo that the Sacraments without their lawfull vſe, are no Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments at all, ſo long as the ſignes are reſerued and not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed.</p>
               <p>The inward partes alſo are <note n="ſ" place="margin">1 Cor. 3.7.</note> foure. Firſt, God the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, offering and applying Chriſt Ieſus, as ſurely as the Miniſter doth the outwarde ſigne, which is a great comfort to ſuch as come to the Sacraments.</p>
               <p>The ſecond inward part of a Sacrament is<note n="t" place="margin">Titus 3.56.</note> the holy Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit working by the worde: ſo that wee can neuer heare the word or receiue the Sacraments aright without the ſpeciall direction and inſpiration of the ſpirit of God, neither muſt we hang vpon extraordinary reuelations, which openeth a wide doore vnto all diſorders, inaſmuch as the Spirite is not ſeparated from the word.</p>
               <p>The third inward part is Ieſus<note n="u" place="margin">1 Cor. 10, 3</note> Chriſt, who is the truth &amp; the life of all Sacraments: nowe if God the Father haue gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen him vnto vs,<note n="a" place="margin">Rom, 8, 32.</note> how ſhal he not with him giue vs al things elſe? Let vs therefore lay hold vpon him, eſpecially in all dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comfits and troubles, when our faith is aſſaulted by the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies of our ſaluation.</p>
               <p>The laſt inward part is the faithfull Receiuer: for except
<pb n="551" facs="tcp:21092:293"/> we<note n="b" place="margin">Ro 14, 23</note> ſend out faith to bring Chriſt home to dwell with vs in our hearts, we ſhall in vaine looke to receiue profite by the Sacraments: ſo that the Reprobate who are veſſels of wrath, and the children of perdition, cannot receiue Chriſt, albeit they partake the ſignes of Chriſt. As for the elect, who are the Lords fealed vp to the day of redemption, before their conuerſion and gathering into the ſheepefold of Chriſt, they alſo onely receiue the outwarde ſigne without Chriſt, inaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as they are without faith: but after they are called with an holie calling effectually, and haue receiued to beleeue vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faignedly, they are partakers both of the ſigne and of the thing ſignified.</p>
               <p>Theſe are the outward and inward parts. Now there<note n="c" place="margin">Actes 8, 36</note> is a fit proportion and agreement betweene theſe partes, each verie aptly anſwering the other. For euen as the miniſter by the word of Inſtitution, offereth and applyeth viſibly the outward element to the bodie of the Receiuer: ſo the father by the ſpirit, offereth and applieth Ieſus Chriſt inuiſibly to the faithfull receiuer.</p>
               <p>Wee ſhewed before, that in a Sacrament wee are to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerue two points, his parts and his vſes. Hitherto we haue ſpoken of all the parts, both ſuch as are outward, and ſuch as are inward. Now it remaineth to handle his vſes. The vſes of a Sacrament<note n="d" place="margin">3. cheefe v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament.</note> are chiefelie three: firſt,<note n="e" place="margin">Rom. 4, 11.</note> to ſtrengthen ſecondly,<note n="f" place="margin">Ge. 17, 1, 11.</note> to ſeale vp the couenant betweene God and vs: thirdlie,<note n="g" place="margin">Epheſ. 2, 11</note> to be a Badge of our profeſſion, and as a banner diſplayed to witneſſe our warefare vnder our chiefe Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine Chriſt Ieſus.</p>
               <p>If theſe be the true vſes and ends of the Sacraments, then we learne to take notice of<note n="h" place="margin">Mark 9 23</note> our owne failinges and infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities of Faith; that GOD refuſeth none for weakeneſſe and wauering of Faith,<note n="i" place="margin">Rom. 4, 11</note> that there is an aſſurance of Fayth to be attained vnto, in this life; that as God euermore kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peth his promiſe with his people,<note n="k" place="margin">Num 23, 15.</note> who is not as man that hee ſhould lie,<note n="l" place="margin">1 Iohn 3, 13</note> nor as the ſonne of man that hee ſhould de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue, ſo muſt we be carefull to keepe the Articles of agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment betweene God and vs, namely to beleeue his word, to loue our bretheren, to obey his will: that the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
<pb n="552" facs="tcp:21092:294"/> belong not to the vnfaithfull, and can do them no good at all, foraſmuch as they be effectual vnto vs by faith. Laſtly, as our priuiledges are great, to beare the badges of Chriſt our Lord, ſo it teacheth that we are not our owne,<note n="m" place="margin">1 Cor. 6, 19 20.</note> but are bought at a great price, not with<note n="n" place="margin">1 Pet. 1, 18.19.</note> coruptible things as ſiluer and gold, but with the precious blood of Chriſt as of a lambe vnſpotted and vndefiled.</p>
               <p>Hitherto of the nature of the Sacraments: now of the number of them, as we vnderſtand the word for ſuch as are ſeales of our communion with Chriſt. The Sacraments<note n="o" place="margin">The Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the new teſtame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t are onely two</note> of the new teſtament are two, baptiſme and the Lords Supper, neither are there any moe left vnto the Church. For Chriſt taught no moe<note n="p" place="margin">1 Cor. 10, 1.2. Act. 20, 27.</note> Sacraments to the Apoſtles, the Apoſtles deliuered no moe to the Churches, who yet were faithfull witneſſes, and reuealed the whole counſell of God, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out concealing and keeping backe of any doctrine which themſelues had receiued. Beſides, theſe two Sacraments are altogether perfect and ſufficient, both to enter a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian into the Church, and to retaine him continually in the ſame. From this number of two Sacraments we learne, firſt to acknowledge the great loue of God toward vs, who hath eaſed vs of the<note n="r" place="margin">Act. 15, 10.</note> heauy burthen of infinite ceremonies preſcribed in the law, and deliuered vs<note n="ſ" place="margin">A<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </note> a few Sacraments in ſtead of many. Secondly, we ſee heereby the difference betweene the old Teſtament and the new, and betweene the Sacraments of the old Teſtament and the new: they had ſundry ſignificant ſignes and ceremonies, whoſe interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation was not eaſily knowne vnto them. Thirdly, ſeeing God hath giuen vnto vs two ſignes, and added two ſeales to his word and writings, we ought to haue the ſtronger faith in his mercifull promiſes. For wherefore hath he doubled the ſignes, but that we ſhould increaſe in faith &amp; as it were double our aſſurance of his graces? Laſtly, this number of two, ouerthroweth the number of ſeaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Sacraments, main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> which iuſt number was<note n="t" place="margin">

Laſtly, they haue aduanced it aboue baptiſme, they adminiſter it in a ſtrange tongue, &amp; hallow the greazy oyle to purifie ſoule and body.</p>
               <p>True it is, they alledge the example of the Apoſtles, who vſed impoſition of hands, ouer thoſe of <hi>Samaria,</hi> Act. 8, 14.

To which prayers we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny not but the ceremony of impoſition of hands may bee added, betokening the reſtraint of our deſires to the parties whom we preſent to God, and declaring thereby that wee pray for them that are before vs. But what is this to the cozenage and impoſture of the Church of Rome that mock God and his people? For the Apoſtles did not conſecrate Oyle mixed with Balme, nor annoint the Samaritans with ſuch Oyle. They did not croſſe their fore-heads, nor kiſſe
<pb n="554" facs="tcp:21092:295"/> their mouths, nor clap their eares, nor binde their faces with fillets, nor forbid them to waſh their heads, neither vſed any ſuch may-game as is now practiſed by the popiſh Biſhops in their apiſh confirmation, who haue it in greater eſtimation then the Sacrament of baptiſme, becauſe they permit the adminiſtration of it to euery Prieſt, yea to priuate perſons, yea to women, yea euen to the <hi>Iewes</hi> and <hi>Infidels</hi> that are out of the Church: whereas they reſerue to the Biſhops onely the power of Confirmation, as if it had greater power to ſtreng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then the ſoule againſt the Diuell.</p>
               <p>Secondly,<note n="c" place="margin">Penance is no ſacrament</note> their pennance inſtituted by bodily chaſtiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to make ſatisfaction for ſin to God, is no Sacrament of the new Teſtament, nor any ſacred thing being thus vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood. For we acknowledge no other ſatisfaction<note n="d" place="margin">1 Ioh, 1, 7.</note> for ſinne, wherein God delighteth, and the conſcience of man reſteth, but only the death and obedience of Chriſt. Beſides, true repentance hath been preached and practiſed from the beginning of the world, after that ſinne entred into the world. Furthermore, their pennance hath no viſible ſigne, as baptiſme and the Supper of the Lord haue. Thirdly,<note n="e" place="margin">Matrimony is no Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</note> ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trimony, albeit it be a diuine ordinance, honorable<note n="f" place="margin">Heb, 13, 4.</note> among all eſtates, yet can be no Sacrament of the Church of Chriſt, becauſe it was inſtituted before<note n="g" place="margin">Gen, 2, 18,</note> the law, it is ratified among the Infidels which are no members of the Church, it hath no promiſe of grace and ſaluation ioyned to it, and albeit it be honourable in all,<note n="h" place="margin">1. Cor, 6, 7.7, 37.</note> yet it is not neceſſary in all.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, the Romaine Church eſteemeth it as an vncleane thing a prophanation of holy orders, a liuing in the fleſh: ſo that as with one hand they aduance it to a great dignity, with the other hand they caſt it downe, with great diſgrace and contempt, as vnworthy of the high &amp; holy prieſt-hood.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, orders come in the next<note n="i" place="margin">Orders no ſacrament.</note> place, which are the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers and miniſtry of the Church, but no Sacrament, or Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments of the Church. For then, according to the number of orders, wee ſhould multiply the number of Sacraments. Neither haue they any outward Element and viſible ſigne.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, we are come to extreame vnction, which we ſuffer not to mask vnder the name of Sacraments, but pull off the
<pb n="557" facs="tcp:21092:295"/> vizard therof, becauſe the church had the vſe of anointing ſo long as it retained the miraculous gift of healing. Beſides, it hath no worde of inſtitution to warrant the continuall practiſe of it, vntil the ſecond comming of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Indeede the Apoſtles and Diſciples were commaunded to annoint the ſicke, and ſo to heale them of their ſicknes; and if any man in our dayes haue this miraculous guifte of healing beſtowed vpon him, we like well that hee ſhoulde annoint the ſicke, and in the name of God vſe the gifte be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed vpon him.

               <p>We learne alſo that ſuch as are once baptized are not to be rebaptized, albeit they haue beene baptized by Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tickes: and that whoſoeuer is baptized hath made a ſolemn Couenant to profeſſe the Chriſtian religion, and to leade an vnblameable and vnreproueable conuerſation, conſidering that he is no longer his owne to liue as he liſt, but as hee is bought with a price, ſo is he bound to ſerue him that hath bought him, and to approoue himſelfe to him in all holie o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience.</p>
               <p>Now we are to conſider in baptiſme (as we did before ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally in a Sacrament) theſe two things,<note place="margin">The parts of Baptiſme.</note> his parts and his vſes. The parts of baptiſme are both outward and inwarde. For as there was a circumciſion of the bodie &amp; of the heart, ſo there is a baptizing of the bodie, and a baptizing of the ſoule. <hi>Iohn the Baptiſt,</hi> in his baptizing directed al to Chriſt, to beleeue in him as Acts 19. and he preached the kingdom of heauen, Math, 3. ſo that there is but one baptiſme of the New Teſtament, Eph: 4. For as wee do baptize with water
<pb n="559" facs="tcp:21092:296"/> vnto Chriſt, and admit men to haue intereſt in the kingdom of God; as we incorporate them into the Church of Chriſt, and offer the promiſe of forgiueneſſe of ſins to them which repent and beleeue the Goſpel: ſo did <hi>Iohn</hi> in his baptiſme,<note place="margin">Acts 8, and 10 and 1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>.</note> who baptized as the Apoſtles did, foraſmuch as both of them are ſaid to baptize in the name of Chriſt. Heerein ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the difference rather in the order of time, then ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of the Sacrament, the one was firſt giuen to the <hi>Iewes</hi> onely, and this latter was communicated vnto the <hi>Gentiles</hi> alſo. We cannot therefore aſſent and agree to them that make two ſundry baptiſmes thereof. For this maketh two baptiſmes no more then it maketh two Goſpels, becauſe Chriſt and his Apoſtles did firſt preach it and publiſh it to the Iſraelites, and afterward vnto the <hi>Gentiles.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Againe, we are put in minde, that when the Sacrament of baptiſme is to be adminiſtred, wee ſhould not make all poſsible haſt out of the Church as the maner of many is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong vs, as though it did nothing at all belong vnto vs, but it is our duty to conteine our ſelues, and continue our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence together with the reſt of our brethren, that by our tarrying wee may to our comfort conſider with our ſelues our owne receiuing heeretofore into the viſible bodie of Chriſts Church and congregation, as alſo that it belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth vnto vs to offers prayers vnto God for the infant that is preſent to be baptized, like as others did in former time for vs, and ſo as it were pay the debt we owe to the church and performe to others that Chriſtian duty which others haue already performed vnto vs.</p>
               <p>Let vs come to the parts of baptiſme. The outwarde parts are theſe foure, the Miniſter of God, the word of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution, the element of water, the bodye to bee waſhed, The firſt outward part is the Miniſter, as the Meſſenger of God. For baptiſme is a part of the Miniſtry and God hath ioyned the miniſtery of the word and the adminiſtration of the Sacraments together. Wherefore the Miniſter muſt be careful and not careleſſe in the execution of his office, who is to ſanctify the water, and to waſh the party.</p>
               <p>Moreouer, the people are directed vnto whom to reſort
<pb n="560" facs="tcp:21092:297"/> when they haue children to bee baptized. Thirdly, the Church of Rome prophane baptiſme, when they appoint Midwiues and priuate perſons to baptize children, nay, do allow Pagans, euen ſuch as are not yet baptized themſelus, and hold it auaileable. Laſtly, it is not fit that the Church ſhould ſet apart ſome ordinarily to baptize, who are not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to preach the word, no more then it is lawfull to ſet a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part an ordinarie Officer for to miniſter the Lordes Supper, which is not able to teach. Beſides, this were to inſtitute a new kinde of Miniſterie, of ſuch who are not called of GOD as <hi>Aaron</hi> was;<note place="margin">Heb. 5, 4.</note> neyther can anie ſufficient reaſon be giuen, vvhy the Church ſhoulde take vppon it this Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertie.</p>
               <p>The ſecond outward part<note place="margin">The ſeconde outward part.</note> is the worde, of inſtitution, which is as the forme of this Sacrament. Now by the word in this place wee vnderſtande the promiſes of the Goſpell, and the forme of adminiſtration therof inſtituted by Chriſt which muſt be in the name of the Father, and of the Sonne, and of the holye Ghoſt. This part and point being thus rightly vnderſtood both teacheth and reprooueth. It ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth to teach that we make not three Gods, as though the Father were a God ſeuerally, the ſonne a God ſeuerally, and the holy Ghoſt a God ſeuerally, albeit theſe be named and reckoned vp ſeuerally: for wee bee not baptized into the names, but in the name: not of many Gods, but of one in nature and eſſence, and triple in perſons and properties. And we muſt beware of this alſo, that we make not an ine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quality of the perſons, and ſuppoſe that the Son is leſſe then the Father, and the holy Ghoſt leſſe then the Sonne, and the Father aboue them both, although the Father bee ſet in the firſt place, the Sonne in the ſecond place, and the holye-Ghoſt in the thirde place, becauſe they are coequall, and none before or aboue the other.</p>
               <p>Beſides, it reprooueth one of the ſlaunders publiſhed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt vs by many friends and fauourites of the Church of Rome, to wit, that we hold and maintaine that wee ought neuer to baptize but when there is a Sermon. But to put them out of doubt, we do no more teach that wee may not
<pb n="561" facs="tcp:21092:297"/> baptize but when there is preaching, then that we may not preach, but when there is baptizing. For none of vs doe beleeue or defend any ſuch doctrine of the abſolute neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity of the preaching of the word at the baptizing of chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, or the receiuing of the Supper, as if the eſſence of the Sacraments depended vpon the preaching or the abſence of preaching did deſtroy the nature of the Sacraments. True it is, we affirme two things. Firſt we ſay, that a Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon is verie fit and conuenient, and alwaies to bee wiſhed if it may be had, becauſe it ſetteth foorth more liuely a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration and demonſtration of Chriſts death.<note place="margin">Iohn 7, 22</note> And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we ſee this practiſed by <hi>Iohn,</hi> &amp; the diſciples of Chriſt. Howbeit it is not ſo needfull and behooueful, as that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out preaching it ſhould bee no baptiſme, or that for want of this it ſhould be reiterated, and the former made voide. And therefore the Prieſts that circumciſed children in the Temple, did not alwaies preach the law to the people, for then they muſt preach not onely vpon the Sabaoth, but e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery day in the weeke, and peraduenture oftentimes in the day, foraſmuch as children were brought at all times to be circumciſed, being preciſely tied vnto the eight day, and therefore as children were borne euerie day of the week, ſo doubtleſſe they were brought to be circumciſed euery day of the weeke. And what Sermon could there be at the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion of <hi>Iohn Baptiſt</hi> the fore-runner of Chriſt,<note place="margin">Luke 1, 62.</note> his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for his vnbeleefe being ſtriken dumb, and ſo not able to ſpeake, Luke 1, 62? Againe, we confeſſe that ſeales with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out writings, are like waxe ſet to a blanke, and therefore baptiſme without the word is altogether vnauaileable and vnprofitable. Notwithſtanding, by the word we do not vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand the ſolemne interpretation of the ſcriptures with doctrine and application, but a declaration of the inſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Chriſt, and a commemoration of the promiſes of the Goſpel. Thus we make the word neceſſarie, and otherwiſe then thus we do not make it to be neceſſarie.</p>
               <p>The third outward part is the element of water,<note place="margin">The 3. out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward part of Baptiſme.</note> which is the matter whereof baptiſme conſiſteth. Whoſoeuer there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore baptizeth with any other liquor then with water, as
<pb n="564" facs="tcp:21092:298"/> with blood, with ſand, with ſnow, with milke, or ſuch like matter, doth fruſtrate baptiſme, and maketh it an ydle Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remony. Againe, all popiſh corruptions, ſuperfluouſly ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded and annexed to this Sacrament, contrary to the ſimpli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city of the Goſpell, as Creame, Croſſes, Cenſers, Tapers, Spittle, Salt, and ſuch like vnſauoury trumpery, are vtterlie condemned, hauing alſo a ſuperſtitious opinion of holines and worſhip ioyned with them. Laſtly, ſeeing water is an outward part, the want of waſhing with water cannot hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the ſaluation of ſuch as die without baptiſme. All peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed not vnder the Law that died without Circumciſion; God is not more rigorous vnder the Goſpell: neither did Chriſt come to condemne thoſe whom the law ſaued. This therefore is a bloody and diſcomfortable doctrine to be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandoned and abiured of all parents, of all children, of all chriſtians. God ſaide at the firſt to <hi>Abraham,</hi> when he inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted circumciſion, <hi>I will be thy God, and the God of thy ſeede,</hi> Gen. 17, 7. And the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaking of children born of faithfull Fathers and Mothers ſaith, <hi>That they be holie.</hi> 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 7, 14. By the ſtrength and vertue of this couenant ſo graciouſly made and faithfully kept, it commeth to paſſe, that the children of beleeuers ſo ſoone as they be borne, do belong to God and to his kingdome.</p>
               <p>The abſolute neceſsitie of Baptiſme,<note place="margin">How baptiſm is abſolutelie neceſſary.</note> we acknowledge in two pointes: firſt, it is neceſſary to haue it celebrated in the church to the end of the world. Chriſt hath commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded it, and the Church ought to keepe this commaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment without ſpot and without rebuke, vntill the appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt. For as the Apoſtle teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth that wee muſt ſhew the Lordes death vntill hee come: ſo we are to baptize the members of the Church, vntill hee come againe to iudge the quicke and the dead.</p>
               <p>Secondlie, it is neceſſarie in this reſpect, becauſe who ſoeuer dooth voluntarily depriue himſelfe of baptiſme, the Sacrament of regeneration, and the ſeale of the righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe by Faith, and dooth wilfully contemne it, as the Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſees did againſt themſelues, cannot be ſaued. For, it is the refuſing, not the wanting; the contempt, not the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priuation
<pb n="565" facs="tcp:21092:298"/> of baptiſme that bringeth with it condemnation; according to that which the Lorde ſpeaketh touching cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion, Gen, 17. <hi>The vncircumciſed male, whoſe fleſh of his foreskinne is not circumciſed, that ſoule ſhall be cut off from his people: he hath broken my Couenant.</hi> But to ſay,<note place="margin">Gen. 17, 14.</note> that God can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not or will not ſaue children without baptiſme, or to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue, that being carried towardes baptiſme, and dying in the way, they are excluded from eternall ſaluation,<note place="margin">Children dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing vvithout baptiſme are not damned.</note> is a raſh and cruell ſentence of corrupt and partiall iudges. Firſt, it is a falſe accuſing of our mercifull God of extreme rigor and ſeuerity, as if he did badlie prouide for the ſaluation of chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren borne vnder the olde teſtament, who were reſtreined circumciſion before the eight day.</p>
               <p>Secondly, it committeth the ſaluation or damnation of children into the power of a man or a Midwife: for if they liſt to baptize them, they ſhall goe into Paradiſe, if they pleaſe not to doe it, then they ſhall neuer come vnto Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, our aduerſaries themſelues, that vrge ſo much the neceſsitie of Baptiſme, do teach in their writings that many are ſaued without the Baptiſme of Water, as ſundrte Martirs that were neuer baptized, but that the ſhedding of their blood hath the force of true baptiſme. And yet (as it is well obſerued) this baptiſme of bloode is contrarie to their owne Cannons, which conclude and determine that it can be no Sacrament, if hee that baptizeth hath not an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to baptize: but they dare not auouch, that the perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuters and executioners conferred baptiſme, or euer had any intent to baptize. And howe is the intent requiſite in him that doth baptize, more then in him that is baptized? To omit this, that manie haue ended their daies by martyr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, that neuer had their blood ſhedde and powred out of their bodies.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, it is agreed vpon on both ſides, that baptiſme is once onely to be adminiſtred to one and the ſame perſon, and not to be iterated or repeated; what reaſon then can bee rendred by them why Martyrdome of a perſon alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die baptized ſhould bee no Sacrament, and that the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirdome
<pb n="564" facs="tcp:21092:299"/> of a perſon not yet baptized, ſhould bee a Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment? For he that hath beene once baptized may bee bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized no more by anie other baptiſme. And thus Martyr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome ſhall be a greater honour and dignity in him that is not baptized, then in him that hath liued and continued in the Church, and beene baptized.</p>
               <p>Fiftly, circumciſion in the olde Teſtament, and baptiſme in the new, are all one, and of like neceſsitie: yet infinite people were ſaued vnder the olde Teſtament without cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion, as all the faithfull women, and ſuch as truelie re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pented amongſt the Niniuites, at the preaching of Ionas.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, our aduerſaries are conſtrained to ioyne with vs in that they confes, that the power of God is not tied to the Sacraments,<note place="margin">Lumb. l <hi>4.</hi> diſt <hi>4</hi>
                  </note> inſomuch that manie partake the trueth of the Sacrament, which do not receiue the outward ſigne of the Sacrament; and that there is a baptiſme of the ſpirit which ſupplieth the depriuation and default of the baptiſm of wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. And this is as much as we deſire: ſo that they teach that which wee teach, and beleeue that which wee be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue.</p>
               <p>The fourth outward part of baptiſme<note place="margin">The 4. out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward part of Bapt.</note> is the bodie that is waſhed.

Theſe are either men and women of riper years, or elſe the infants of ſuch who haue interreſt in baptiſme as well as the parents of whome they are borne. This con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demneth the Romiſh practiſe of Baptizing Belles, as a moſt horrible prophanation of this Sacrament, and ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth to ſet foorth the great loue of God vnto all beleeuers, who vouchſafeth to bee their God and the God of theyr ſeede. Hence likewiſe it appeareth,<note n="d" place="margin">Infants haue intereſt in baptiſme as well as their parents.</note> that infants are to be baptized. For baptiſme ſucceedeth in place of Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion, the Apoſtles baptized<note n="e" place="margin">Coloſ. 2, 11.</note> whole houſes, Chriſt calleth infants and ſucklings<note n="f" place="margin">Act. 16, 15, 33</note> vnto himſelfe, and ſaith that vnto ſuch belongeth the Kingdome of Heauen: they are Chriſts ſheepe and members of his body: Hence we learne,
<pb n="565" facs="tcp:21092:299"/> that the baptiſme of Infants is no vnwritten tradition, but a written and diuine inſtitution taught in the Scriptures. Conſider alſo heereby, the difference betweene baptiſme and the Lords Supper,<note n="g" place="margin">1 Cor. 14, 16 Mar. 10, 13, 14 15.</note> and that all are conceiued in origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall ſinne.

               <p>Hitherto of the outward parts: now follow<note n="i" place="margin">Eph. 6, 4.</note> the inward parts, which alſo are four in number. Firſt,<note n="k" place="margin">The inward parts of bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm are four.</note> God the Father repreſented by the Miniſter, whereby our faith is greatly ſtrengthned. For whenſoeuer the eie ſeeth the Miniſter pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring water on the body, faith beholdeth God the Father clenſing the ſoule with the precious blood of his Son Chriſt. The ſecond part is the Spirit<note n="l" place="margin">Mat. 28, 19</note> of God, hauing relation to the word and promiſe of God: and therefore whenſoeuer we come to heare the word or to receiue the Sacraments, we muſt craue the aſsiſtance of the Spirit to open our harts,<note n="m" place="margin">1 cor. 12, 12</note> as he opened the hart of <hi>Lydia.</hi> If this inward teacher be wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, the eare heareth, and the hand handleth, but the hart is hardned. The third inward part of baptiſm<note n="n" place="margin">Act. 16, 14</note> is Chriſt repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented by the water. This ſerueth greatly to confirme our faith, to conſider with our ſelues, when we behold with our bodily eyes the water poured vpon the body baptized,<note n="o" place="margin">Act. 2, 38.</note> the blotting out of all our ſins by the blood of Chriſt Ieſus. The 4. inward part is the ſoule clenſed,<note n="p" place="margin">1 Pet. 3, 21.</note> moſt liuely and effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally repreſented by the body waſhed. For the waſhing of the body repreſenteth the clenſing of the ſoule. This teacheth, that by nature we are corrupt and abhominable,<note n="q" place="margin">Ep. 5, 26, 27</note> ſo that God muſt worke in vs both the will and the deed. Theſe are the foure inward parts of baptiſme. The agreeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t between theſe outward and inward parts<note n="r" place="margin">The pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward parts of baptiſme.</note> is very euident. Fot as the Miniſter by the word of inſtitution, applieth water to the waſhing of the body: ſo the Father through the working of the Spirit, applieth the blood of Chriſt to the clenſing of the ſoule.</p>
               <p>This diſtinction and proportion of the parts, to wit, the outwarde with the inwarde, ſerueth to determine
<pb n="566" facs="tcp:21092:300"/> manie Controuerſies, vntimely raiſed, hotly purſued, and vncharitably continued among vs. For if we did aright diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne the outward baptiſm from the inward, &amp; that which the Miniſter doth deliuer from that which God doth giue and beſtow, it might be a good meanes to diſſolue ſundrie doubts, touching the ſufficiencie and efficacy of this Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, whether it be impeached or aboliſhed by the euill of the Miniſter, which is of three ſorts of hereſy impiety and ignorance.</p>
               <p>The firſt queſtion is touching hereſie,<note place="margin">Touching the baptiſ. of the Heretickes.</note> whether baptiſme miniſtred by an Hereticke be true baptiſme or not? I aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere, If Heretiques keepe not the ſubſtance of baptiſme, but erre in the foundation of religion, and the doctrine of the Trinity, their baptiſme can be no baptiſme. Hence it is that <hi>Nicephorus</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Niceph. hiſt. lib. <hi>3.</hi> cap <hi>33</hi>
                  </note> maketh mention of a Miniſter, that in the want of water baptized with ſand<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but the party was again baptized, and that moſt iuſtly. But if they keepe the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of the Sacrament ſound in ſubſtance, and faile not in the eſſentiall partes of it, ſuch baptiſme is good baptiſme, and ought not to be repeated. For as the truth taught by Heretickes is Gods truth, and auaileable to edification, ſo long as they preach out of Gods word: ſo baptiſme admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtred by them is true baptiſme, ſo long as they obſerue the inſtitution of God entire and vncorrupt.</p>
               <p>The ſecond Queſtion is touching the ſcandalous life &amp; pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane heart of the Miniſter, whether it hinder the effect of the Sacrament or not?<note place="margin">Touching the baptiſme of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uil Miniſters.</note> I anſwere it dooth not: for as good prayers conceiued by euill men haue alſo audience vvith God, ſo it is with the Sacraments, albeit they be adminiſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by euill men, yet haue they acceptance with God. And albeit the ſonnes of <hi>Eli</hi> did occaſion the people to abhorre the offerings of the Lorde, yet it is their ſinne to abſtaine. <hi>Iudas</hi> beeing ſent out to preach miniſtered Baptiſme alſo, which was no doubt effectuall and ſufficient to the Recey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers, albeit he were a damnable hypocrite and the child of perdition.</p>
               <p>True it is, he receiued no benefit by the word or the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments, yet he might bee a meanes of doing good to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.
<pb n="567" facs="tcp:21092:300"/> The light of the Sunne paſſeth by myrie and vnclean places, and yet it is not defiled; ſo the dignitie of the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is not hindred by the lewdneſſe of the Miniſter. The Sacraments brought vnto vs by looſe Miniſters (which are no better then ſtumbling-blockes laide before the weake,<note place="margin">Aug. in Iohan. tract. <hi>5.</hi>
                  </note> are like water that paſſeth thorough a Chanell into a Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, it ſelfe receiueth no benefit by it, howbeit the garden is watered and made fruitfull thereby. Manie of the Prieſts and Leuites among the Iſraelites were vngodly and vnſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified, yet they both offered ſacrifices, and celebrated Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments, which to the right partakers were feales of the Couenants, and meanes to encreaſe faith.</p>
               <p>Again, there is no difference in reſpect of God between him that is prophane in heart, and him that is prophane in life; betweene him that is prophane outwardlye, and him that is prophane inwardly, foraſmuch as they are both a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like knowne vnto him. But no man knoweth what is in the heart, and therefore if prophaneneſſe did hinder the fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſſe of the Sacrament, no man could be aſſured that at any time he receiued a Sacrament, but muſt alwaies hang in ſuſpenſe and doubt of the matter. Let no man therfore refuſe or abhorre the Lords ordinances for the euil demea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of the Miniſters, as no man will reiect the guifte of a Prince, albeit a wicked perſon ſhould drawe the conuey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance.</p>
               <p>The third and laſt queſtion remaineth, which is, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the ignorance or vnabilitie of the Miniſter to preach,<note place="margin">Touching the bapt of igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant miniſters</note> do diſanull the ſufficiency and efficacy of the Sacrament to the receiuer that beleeueth? It were to bee wiſhed that euery Congregation had his learned Paſtor, that ſo the oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion of this Queſtion might be cut off: but becauſe wee cannot haue ſo flouriſhing a Church, we muſt conſider the matter as the caſe ſtandeth with vs, and know that his ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions are not nullities. For the Apoſtle requireth, that the Miniſter ſhould be vnreprooueable in life,<note place="margin">1 Tim. 3.2.</note> as well as apt to teach, 1 Tim. 3. If then his euill life doe not diſanull his worke, why ſhould his ignorance be a greater bar? If then any reaſon thus: <hi>Euery Miniſtery of the New-Testament</hi>
                  <pb n="568" facs="tcp:21092:301"/> is a preaching Miniſtery,</p>
               <p>Therefore Sacraments are voide, that are deliuered by no preachers:</p>
               <p>Why may we not reaſon in like manner and as ſtrongly, Euery Miniſterie of the New-Teſtament is an vnblameable miniſtery,</p>
               <p>Therefore Sacraments are void that are deliuered by them that are not vnreprooueable.</p>
               <p>Indeede euery good miniſterie is a preaching miniſtery, but not euerie miniſtery in generall: and therefore it will not follow that the action of him that is no preacher is a nullity<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

This coniunction with Chriſt is not bodily or naturall, but myſticall and maruellous in our eies: for we are made one with Chriſt,<note n="t" place="margin">1 Cor. 6, 17.</note> by the ſame Spirit dwelling in Chriſt and in all the members of Chriſt. So then, the Saintes triumphing in heauen, and all the beleeuers fighting vpon earth, as ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers in warefare, haue one and the ſame ſpirite of Chriſt dwelling in them, and therefore are one with him. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, to aſſure vs of the remiſſion of our ſinnes, that we may be able to ſtand in the preſence of God,<note n="u" place="margin">Gal. 3, 17.</note> hauing put on the garments of Chriſt, as <hi>Iacob</hi> receiud the bleſsing clad in the garments of his elder brother. This ouerthroweth the doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine or rather doting of the Church of Rome, which tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth that baptiſme aboliſheth all ſinnes going before it, and leaueth nothing that hath the name or nature of ſinne. If this were a trueth of God not a dreame of men, it is not onely decent, but greatly to be deſired, to haue baptiſme deferred vntill olde age, nay vnto the houre of death, that fo we may depart hence in peace with greater aſſurance of Gods fauour in the pardon of our ſinnes. Thirdly,<note n="a" place="margin">Marke, 1, 1.</note> to ſlay the olde man, and to kill our naturall corruption by the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer of the death and buriall of Chriſt; beſides, to raiſe vs
<pb n="569" facs="tcp:21092:301"/> vp againe to holineſſe and newneſſe of life by his reſurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Hence it is, that the Euangeliſts call it the Sacrament of Repentance, admoniſhing euerie one of vs to expreſſe the ſtrength &amp; power of baptiſme, as the Prophets oftentimes exhort the Iewes to<note n="b" place="margin">Deut: 10, 15.</note> circumciſe the foreskin of their harts, and to harden their neckes no more. So wee ought not to content our ſelues to be baptized in bodie, but muſt labour to be baptized in ſoule by a daily proceeding in regenera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, by bringing foorth the fruites of ſanctification, and applying Chriſt Ieſus to our full iuſtification.</p>
               <p>Thus much of baptiſme, the honourable badge of our profeſsion and dedication to Chriſt that dyed vppon the Croſſe, what it is, what are the parts and vſes thereof. Now wee come to<note n="d" place="margin">The ſum of the 3. Booke.</note> the Sacrament of the bodie and bloode of Chriſt, which is called by diuers and ſundrie names in the New Teſtament. Sometimes it is called the<note n="f" place="margin">1 Cor. 10, 16</note> Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, teaching that wee are one bodye coupled togethet in Chriſt, ſhewing that it is to bee receyued of manie toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and admoniſhing vs of vnitie and concord among our ſelues.</p>
               <p>Sometimes, it is<note n="g" place="margin">1 Cor. 11, 20</note> called the Lordes Supper, hence wee ſee who is the authour of it, no Man, no Angell, but the Lord Ieſus, leauing it for a fare-well token of his Loue to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards vs. Wee muſt alſo come with an earneſt deſire hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gring after Chriſt, that we may be ſatisfied with his righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe. Sometimes, it is called the<note n="h" place="margin">Actes 2, 42.</note> breaking of bread: this ſheweth, that the ſubſtance of breade remaineth after the words of conſecration, that figuratiue ſpeeches are v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in the Sacrament, and that this externall rite of break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the bread, vſed by Chriſt, practiſed by the Apoſtles, obſerued by the paſtors of the Church, ought not to bee o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted and ouer-paſſed. Sometimes, it is called the<note n="i" place="margin">1 Cor, 10, 21</note> Table of the Lord: this teacheth, that Chriſt and his Apoſtles, at the celebration of it, vſed a table not an Altar, that it is a Sacrament, not a Sacrifice, and that we ought to draw nere vnto it with all regard and reuerence. Laſtlie, it is called the New teſtament or Will of Chriſt. This title teacheth, that there is a double Couenant betweene GOD and man,
<pb n="570" facs="tcp:21092:302"/> the one old, the other new: the one of the law, the other of the Goſpell: the firſt of workes, the ſecond of grace.</p>
               <p>Againe, it ſerueth to condemne the curſed ſacriledge of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> which addeth and detracteth, altereth, and mingleth it with the leauen of her owne inuentions. This is a great comfort to all Gods children, to conſider that all faithfull Chriſtians are the heires of Chriſt, to who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he hath promiſed ſaluation of their ſoules, and forgiuenes of their ſinnes.</p>
               <p>As we haue ſeene the ſeuerall names of this Sacrament, which ſhew the nature thereof vnto vs: ſo now we will ſet downe<note n="k" place="margin">What the Lords Supper is.</note> what the Lords Supper is. The Supper of the Lord is the ſecond Sacrament, wherein by viſible receiuing of bread and wine, is repreſented our ſpirituall communion with the body and blood of Chriſt. Heere God is preſent, and ſitteth as preſident at this Table, he offereth vnto vs his owne Son for our iuſtification, and therefore this Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per muſt be reuerently regarded, and diligently frequented of vs.</p>
               <p>In this Sacrament<note n="l" place="margin">In the lords Supper con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider hi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> parts and his vſes.</note> we are in like manner to conſider the parts and the vſes thereof. The parts are partly outward, and partly inward. For it fareth no otherwiſe with the Sacrament, then it doth with man conſidered in his partes. A man is a compound creature, made of fleſh and of a rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable ſoule, as <hi>Athanaſius</hi> ſpeaketh in his Creede. If the queſtion were asked whether man were a mortall creature or immortall, earthly or heauenly, viſible or inuiſible? No man coulde rightly anſwere without a diſtinction; to wit, that he is earthly touching his body, &amp; heauenly touching his ſpirit. In like ſort we muſt conſider touching the lords ſupper, which is made of an earthly and an heauenly thing: and therefore if the queſtion be demaunded, whether it be an earthly or an heauenly thing? Wee muſt reſolue that in part it is earthly, and in part heauenly, earthly in the figure, and heauenly in the matter that is ſignified. We muſt ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge from hence, the diuers natures and partes of it, diſtinguiſhing the one from the other.</p>
               <p>Then had neuer riſen ſo great conte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tion &amp; confuſion in the
<pb n="571" facs="tcp:21092:302"/> Church of Chriſt touching this Supper, if this diſtinction had heene wiſely obſerued, and if what is proper vnto the outward parts, and what proper to the inwarde had beene duely marked. The ignorance of this point hath bred much debate, and kindled a fire that will very hardly bee quen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched.</p>
               <p>The outward parts are<note n="m" place="margin">The out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward parts are foure.</note> foure. Firſt the Miniſter, who is to take the bread and wine into his handes<note n="n" place="margin">1 Cor. 11, 23</note> after the exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of Chriſt, to ſeparate the Bread and Wine, ſo taken from their common vſe to an holy, to breake the bread, to poure out the Wine, and deliuer them both into the handes of all the people preſent: for it is not for euerie man to miniſter in the Church of God, and to beſtowe and diſpoſe the My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteries of Chriſt. The Apoſtles were preſent at the Supper, not as diſpenſers, but as communicants; not as Miniſters, but as gheſſe: Chriſt was as the maiſter and maker of the Feaſt inſtituting with his owne hands the Sacrament of his grace.</p>
               <p>So then they are not conſecrated<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to be Prieſtes of the New teſtament, but preachers of the Goſpell and miniſters of the Sacraments: and therefore priuate perſons may not take this Supper to themſelues or deliuer it to others. The ſecond part is the word of Inſtitution,<note n="o" place="margin">Luke 22, 19</note> 
                  <hi>This is my body,</hi> that is, this bread is<note n="p" place="margin">Tertul. lib. <hi>4.</hi> cont. Marcio auguſt. conr. a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dimant. cap. <hi>12.</hi>

Theſe words are not properly but figuratiuely to be vnderſtood, beeing Sacramentall ſpeeches.</p>
               <p>Thus the Scripture ſpeaketh of<note n="q" place="margin">Gen. 17, 10</note> Circumciſion &amp; of the Paſchall Lambe. The third outward part are bread &amp; wine, fit ſignes to ſignify our ſpirituall nouriſhment by eating the body, and drinking the bloode of Chriſt. In baptiſme wee haue one onely ſigne, but in this ſupper<note n="r" place="margin">Mark 14, 12</note> we haue two, to note out our full and perfect nouriſhment by Chriſt. Neither did Chriſt deliuer the deceiueable ſhewes of bread and wine or caſt a miſt before the eies of his Diſciples, to make them thinke it Bread which was no bread, or wine which was no

Heereby falleth to the ground the myſtery of tranſubſtantiation, the moſt miſhapen monſter that euer liued or was deuiſed. It bringeth in a falſe Chriſt, and turneth him into an Idoll: it maketh Sacraments with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſignes: it maketh Chriſt to haue an infinite body, who is like to vs in all things<note n="t" place="margin">Heb. 4, 15</note> ſinne onely excepted: Laſtly, it confoundeth heauen and earth together. <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Obiection. </seg>
                  </label> Neither let any obiect that Chriſt hath now a glorified body, ſitting at the right hand of his Father, and therfore his body hath a great priuiledge aboue ours, to bee in diuers places at the ſame time. <label type="milestone">

                  </label> For firſt, when the holy Supper was inſtituted, the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of Chriſt was not glorified. Againe, glorification doth not take away the nature of a true body, but taketh away the infirmity and weaknes thereof.

They make it of the eſſence of the Sacrament, to vſe vnlea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uened bread, and to mingle water with wine, which Chriſt neuer ordained or commanded: but that which is neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, they eſteeme as needles and ſuperfluous, thus tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſing the commandement of God by their owne tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. The fourth outward part are the Communicants, whoſe duty it is,<note n="c" place="margin">Mat. 26, 26.</note> to take the bread and wine into their hands, to eate the bread and to drinke the wine to the nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhment of their bodies.

This ſheweth, that he is true<note n="i" place="margin">Reuel. 1, 4.</note> God equall with the Father and the Son, proceeding from the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and the Son. This confuteth ſuch as ſuppoſe no parta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of the body and blood of Chriſt, except he bee giuen vs in a carnal and fleſhy manner: wheras the Spirit worketh faith in our hearts,<note n="k" place="margin">Heb. 11.1</note> which is the ground of things which are hoped for, and the euidence of things which are not ſeene. The third inward part of the Lords Supper,<note n="l" place="margin">Luk. 22, 19</note> is the body &amp; blood of Chriſt, deliuered for vs vnto death. This conuin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth ſuch of a ſpirit of error, who make vnbeleeuers and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probates partakers of Chriſts body and blood: thus his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy ſhould be prophaned,<note n="m" place="margin">Ioh 6, 5</note> and his ſauing graces ſeparated from his perſon. But euen as where Sathan dwelleth &amp; poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſeth the heart, there alwaies raigne the works of darknes, and damnation: ſo the gifts of Chriſt accompanying ſalua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, are inſeparably ioyned with the perſon of Chriſt.

True it is, Chriſt is truely preſent in the Sacrament, howbeit not carnally, and corporally, but ſpiritually and myſtically.

For no ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> can communicate with his body, but the ſame is made par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taker of his benefits. Let vs all prepare the true and liuely faith<note n="o" place="margin">Tit. 1.1.</note> of Gods elect, and aſſure our ſelues that hypocrites and vnbeleeuers cannot poſsibly be partakers of the body and blood of Chriſt.

The ſimilitude and relation<note n="p" place="margin">The propor<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tion betwixt the outward and inward parts of the Supper.</note> of the outward and inward parts one to another ſtandeth in this manner, euen as the Miniſter by the words of inſtitution, offereth and giueth bread and wine to the Communicants, to feed thereupon bodily: ſo the Father by the Spirit, offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth and exhibiteth the body and blood of Chriſt Ieſus, to the ſoules of the faithful to feed vpon them ſpiritually.

<pb n="575" facs="tcp:21092:304"/> nor Angels, nor principalities, nor powers, nor things pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, nor things to come, nor height, nor depth, nor any other creature ſhalbe able to ſeparate vs from the loue of GOD, which is in Chriſt Ieſus our Lord. But on the other ſide, the vngodly and vnbeleeuers haue no part or portion in Chriſt and his graces, they are as branches<note n="u" place="margin">Ioh. 15, 6.</note> cut off which wither, and men gather them to caſt them into the fire and to burne them. Thirdly, to declare and teſtifie our Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion, fellowſhip, and<note n="a" place="margin">1 Cor. 10, 17</note> agreement with our brethre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, mee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting together at the ſame Table, and partaking together of the ſame Supper. Wherefore, ſeeing we haue not onely an vnion with Chriſt, but a Communion among our ſelues, we are the ſeruants of the Church, to ſerue one another in all duties of loue, to inſtruct them that are ignorant, to raiſe them that are fallen, and to binde vp the broken hearted, to reconcile our ſelues one toward another, and to keepe the vnity of the Spirit in the bond of peace. Hitherto we haue handled the doctrine of the Lords Supper, declaring what it is, what are the parts and vſes thereof; the preparation to this worke followeth,<note n="b" place="margin">1 Cor. 11.28</note> conſiſting in the examination of our ſelues, and trying our owne hearts by the touchſtone of the law of God. This duty is very neceſſary to be perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med of vs,<note n="c" place="margin">Ier. 17, 9.</note> for the heart of man is deceitful aboue al things, and the ſecret corners of it paſt finding out. We haue to deale with God in this buſineſſe. Great is the profit which we reape and receiue, if we come rightly and reuerently pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared. Great is the puniſhment procured, by want of this tryall and examination. And the<note n="d" place="margin">Hag. 2 14</note> Sacrament it ſelfe is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filed, by vnworthy receiuing. This preparation princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally ſtandeth in theſe foure points: in the<note n="e" place="margin">Ioh. 17, 3.</note> knowledge of God and of our ſeluess eſpecially of the whole doctrine of the Sacraments: in a<note n="f" place="margin">2 Cor. 13, 5</note> liuely faith in Chriſt, ſeeing euery one receiueth ſo much as he beleeueth he receiueth: in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance<note n="g" place="margin">Pſal. 26, 6.</note> from dead workes: and laſtly in<note n="h" place="margin">Mat. 5, 23.</note> reconciliation toward our brethren, hauing peace<note n="i" place="margin">Rom. 12.18.</note> with all men, and loue toward our enemies.</p>
               <p>Thus I haue opened plainely, yet truely, the doctrine of the Sacraments, deliuered in the Scriptures, and taught in
<pb n="576" facs="tcp:21092:305"/> the reformed Churches. I haue diſcloſed ſome part of the myſtery of Iniquity, and diſcouered and laid open the skirts of that great Idoll of the Maſſe, the reproach of Chriſtians, the ſcorne of the Gentiles, the offence of the weake, and the occaſion of ruine to many that ſtumble thereat to their own confuſion. The Lord God, high poſſeſſor of heauen and earth, and preſeruer of his people that call vpon him, put it into the hart of al Chriſtian Princes and Rulers of the earth, to pull downe this abhominable Idoll, that hath aduanced it ſelfe againſt the kingdome of Chriſt, and to deface this filthy monſter that hath deceiued many, who truſted in it. The ſame Lord vouchſafe to reueale his truth to the igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant, to eſtabliſh them that are weake, and to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found all obſtinate enemies to his truth, to their Prince, and to their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, for Ieſus Chriſts ſake, Amen. <hi>Amen.</hi>
